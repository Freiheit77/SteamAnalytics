Extra points for this.\\nThe variety in enemy types, weapon pickups and character designs took a lot of evident effort. I believe the creators should be truly commended for this. The first time bouncy balls showed up had me go \"Oh S**t there\\'s goddamn bouncy balls!\" out loud... I never thought I\\'d be afraid of bouncy balls!\\n\\n10/10 excellent fun game.',\n",
