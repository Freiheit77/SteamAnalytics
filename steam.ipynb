The gameplay is fun and addictive. The devs responded to a server bug regarding Steam friend joining within a day of launch - which has far exceeded my expectations!\\n\\nI get a bit of nostalgia as well, as it reminds me of the old Toy Story and Army Men games. Additionally, the weapon mods and construction options add a level of depth to the game.\\n\\nIt's an absolute blast with awesome music and addictive gameplay. What else could you ask for?!\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I\\'m absolutely blown away. This game is giving me a nostalgia trip I didn\\'t even know I could feel.\\n\\nGameplay wise, it\\'s like a more polished version of the Mean Greens crossed over with Sanctum/Orcs Must Die/Dungeon Defenders - And stylistically I\\'m getting Toy Story vibes. I\\'m not sure how many potential buyers will have played the original Toy Story games, but I\\'ve been dying for something with \"tiny toys in a big environment\" levels for years, and this scratches that itch.\\n\\nThe game runs at a solid 144fps for me (capped by me, it could well go higher than that), and it\\'s absolutely gorgeous - If I didn\\'t know this was a 5-man team, I\\'d have assumed this was a triple A title. Lighting is amazingly done, and the textures are high resolution.\\n\\nThere\\'s a plethora of content, and getting the highest tier medal on each level will take you a long time - I struggled getting a gold medal on normal difficulty on the *first* level.\\n\\nThe price is incredibly generous for what you get - Having played the game, I would have paid double.\\n\\nOh also, split-screen - Something often overlooked in modern titles, this is a really nice throwback to the PS1/PS2 era. I\\'ll definitely be taking advantage of this as it\\'s a brilliant and uncommon feature.\\n\\nI\\'d thoroughly recommend this to any fans of a) action figures, b) nostalgia, c) Sanctum, d) Toy Story, e) Orcs Must Die, f) Dungeon Defenders, and g) video games.\\n\\nAn easy 10/10, and something I\\'ll be coming back to for a long time. Hope to see the devs succeed and for the amount of people onboard to keep rising.',\n",

Think of Kf2/Sanctum but with platforming in-between waves to get even more currency set in some cool designed maps such as a toy store, a bedroom and a toy store. Most enemies are direct throwback to 80-90s toys such as \"beyblades\", army men, RC Chooper/Robots and even T-Rexs. I just hope the game will get continuous support even if 1.0 released\\n\\nFor the PvP aspect of it I sadly can\\'t comment since PVP is not my main interest',\n",

       "   'review': \"━●━ Un des meilleurs jeux de Tower Defense multijoueur auquel j'ai jamais joué. Principe simple : vous arrivez sur un serveur de 4 joueurs max ou vous devez combattre des jouets qui vont essayer de détruire vos défenses. Vous allez devoir vous débrouiller pour récolter des pièces qui vous serviront d'argent pour construire vos défenses. Les pièces et objets sont cachés dans la map aléatoirement. PS : vous avez selon les maps plusieurs tours à défendre. Vous avez aussi un système de magasin dans chaque maps qui vous permettrons d'acheter des armes et des équipement d'armes. Une système de customisation est disponible pour personnalisé votre personnage vos skins d'armes et même vos constructions peuvent avoir un skins.\\n\\n━●━ La seule chose que l'on pourrait reprocher au gameplay c'est que les armes ne sont pas assez variées mais le jeu vient tout juste de sortir.\\n\\n► Le gameplay est bien équilibré et assez stratégique, il est très bien pensé. Le jeu nécessite aucune connaissance particulière même qu'au début vous avez un tutoriel pour vous apprendre à jouer. Mais en général après deux trois parties c'est très simple de comprendre le gameplay. Le mode construction est très bien pensé vous pouvez construire des rempart en LEGO, des pièges ainsi que des tourelles qui vont permettre de défendre vos tours.\\n\\n► Le moteur physique fait des merveilles, vous avez adoré Toy Story 3 ? Vous allez aimer ce jeu !  Les déplacements sont très agréables, les mouvements sont très fluides et me font pensé à du Battlefield et du Halo. Les collisions sont très bien respectées. Animations très bien faites.\\n\\n► Le moteur graphique est aussi de bonne qualité. Mention spéciale aux effets de lumières et particules qui rendent particulièrement bien. Le jeu est très bien optimisé que sa soit sur un ordinateur Basse Performance ou une ordinateur Haute Performance. Les détails des maps, et puis le fait que l'ont soit tout petit, les perspectives sont vraiment très immersives. L'aspect visuel est vraiment incroyable.\\n\\n► La qualité sonore du jeu est folle. Les bandes-son sont superbe plus de 20 morceaux uniques ! le travail d'accompagnement musical des différentes phases de jeu sont également bien pensés.\\nL'annonceur est très convaincant et les bruitages des jouets comme des armes et des équipements sont juste jouissif. Les voix des joueurs quand on parle dans le jeu sont correctes, on entend bien les joueurs.\\n\\nJe recommande HYPERCHARHE : Unboxed , car il le mérite amplement.\\nSoutenez-le, achetez-le, il en vaut la peine.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I'm a huge fan of the Action Tower Defense genre. It's criminally underrated with few games that really champion what works the most. Throughout this review, where necessary, I'm going to compare this game to what I consider to be the magnum opus of the genre, Orcs Must Die! 2. \\n\\n[h1] Presentation [/h1]\\nThis game has an undeniable charm in its toy aesthetics. I work at Target right now as I'm getting my degree and can tell you that the attention to detail in the super market areas is pretty incredible. From the diamonds on the shelves to put up fencing, to the Zebra PDAs. While PDAs are sort of outdated I have to admit it's definitely cool to see. \\n\\nThe visuals from a screenshot basis are probably the best part of the game. Not to downplay other areas, but it truly shines while weaving a wonderful cloak of nostalgia and charm. However in motion you start to see the seams.\\n\\nThe animations in the game are definitely pretty weak. The first thing I noticed was the melee attack. The motion looks as if it was animated along a standard curve with little tweaking or personality injection. It doesn't really feel satisfying to hit things. There are other qualms I have with the animation, but it has a subtle effect that I can't help but have it linger in the back of my mind as I'm playing thinking that something doesn't look right. This disconnect is further supported by the next topic.\\n\\n[h1] Movement [/h1]\\nThis is a really big thing for me. This is also why I wanted to mention Orcs Must Die! 2, as well. Neither of these games have very complex movement systems. They're both standard fare, but OMD just feels so much better to control. When I see an enemy getting toward a Hypercore, I want to feel like I've got a chance to sprint over there and save it. The movement and controls are so sluggish to the point where I can't help but watch powerlessly as the enemies bash through my defenses as I frustratingly fumble while climbing up various boxes, moon jumping halo style, and slow trot my way over, even while sprinting, to try and save the mission.\\n\\nThis is where you get a split in the genre between games like Dungeon Defenders and Orcs. In DD your traps are crazy effective when set up optimally. To the point where your personal intervention can be optional. Your movement is also slow and your platforming options are limited to say the least. Orcs is a different story. Yes your traps are effective, but without your personal interjection you aren't going to pass the level. The movement is there to support that gameplay style, too. Walking speed is quick, but sprinting really makes you feels like you have a chance to make a last second save if needed. This game? I didn't even realize I was sprinting.\\n\\nThe frustration starts to swirl when your movement fails you. You end up not wondering what you did wrong, but asking yourself why the game didn't give you the toolset you needed for the gameplay it's driving. \\n\\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\\nThis was pretty disappointing to me. Traps are interesting and diverse, but limiting you to preset placement locations immediately drains the creativity out of the equation. There were so many places that I thought traps would be great and present interesting and fun gameplay moments, but while I was trying to have this dialogue with these mechanics by placing down a trap where I thought was the most optimal, the game wouldn't let me because it wasn't where IT wanted me to put them. It's honestly tragic and almost puts the nail into the coffin for me.\\n\\n[h1] Quality of Life Changes / Suggestions [/h1]\\nMovement speed needs to be scaled up. I've seen a lot of people echo this sentiment, so I can't be alone.\\n\\nA little marker / path showing what routes the enemies will be taking upon spawn. Orcs Must Die does this and it helps greatly. I don't feel like I need to restart the mission because I wasn't privy to this information that I could only know from trial and error. It's an easy implementation and would massively not only increase accessibility, but help the flow of the game.\\n\\nTweaking animations shouldn't be a top priority given the other more mechanical issues the game has, but this would be something that is nice to see.\\n\\n[h1] Final Thoughts [/h1]\\nIn its current state I would prefer to give it an in between review. However Steam's binary review options leave me with a thumbs down. Where it shines it really shines, but underneath that nice coat of paint is an engine that stalls and sputters in the most unfortunate ways. I like the developer's response to feedback and I hope they take it to heart. Borrowing things from other games in the genre isn't a bad thing, they become tropes for a reason. I just hope they can look at some of their peer's projects and see what worked, what didn't and maybe jot down some notes along the way.\\n\\nEdit: Formatting\",\n",

       "   'review': \"If you are prone to any sort of nausea when playing FPS games, you may want to be careful here.\\n\\nI can handle most games, but there are some VR games that put me in a bad state.  This game makes me feel like I played a bad VR game due to the following reasons:\\n\\n- The entire camera shakes when you shoot your gun, instead of just the gun itself.  This may not be so bad if it were subtle, but it's not subtle at all; the whole screen shakes violently.\\n- The camera tilts at an angle when strafing.  This makes it appear like the camera is locked to the player model's head and the player model leans when it strafes.  Can't say for sure, but this is how it appears.  This is also the most nauseating thing... eyes to do not do this when you move side to side in real life or tilt your head.  When you combine this with the camera shake, it's a recipe for that bad VR feel.\\n- Motion blur that cannot be disabled.  This isn't nearly as bad as the other two, but it still sucks.\\n\\nCan't recommend this game in its current state, and since it doesn't look like there's any way to disable all this camera WTFery (it almost seems like the devs have never played a shooter before), I'm probably going to have to refund this.\\n\\nSucks too, because the premise seems super awesome and tearing out of a toy package as an action figure on a shelf was such a great start.\",\n",

The scale of everything is very Toy-storyish which is what I'm sure they were going for, and it's a success in that regard.  The guns and melee need more oomph, and it would be nice if the sprinting could work in strafe rather than just a straight line (it's like Destiny) but these are minor quibbles.   It's a small team.  I'm sure they'll get it working.  I'll check back in when it's released in full.\",\n",

Without some RNG aspect, like gear/armor/equipment with stats(like in dungeon defenders) there is no reason to play after you unlock everything.

Granite I do have a high-end computer, but the fact I had everything on the highest with a few things disabled, I was getting 60 to 90fps maybe more on some of the maps we played in that 3 hours. The main core gameplay has been done several times, this one has a nice twist to it though. The gunplay is simple and works, though would like a little more variety/more attachments. The Devs did a really great job with split-screen and also allowing for every type of controller from all the consoles to work with playing together. The only bad thing I can really say about this game, is the fact the game doesn't have the ability for you to completely have control of your individual screens (ofc if u have more than one) and set the players to a certain screen, also to have the ability to also be horizontal/vertical like there is already. If this is a possibility would love to see this feature besides dealing with a terrible software feature aka Nvidia spanning shit.

I've been looking for a child friendly game that I can play with my brother and his son. \\n\\nThis is my honest and unbiased short review of the game.\\n\\nGraphics:\\nI can say that a lot of effort has been put to HYPERCHARGE when it comes to details. The real time image reflection, shadows, lighting and how unique the stages are. If there would be some improvements for the game, I suggest that some special effects on the player's characters.\\n\\nControls:\\nControls are just like the other FPS Games, easy to use and navigate. Simple yet effective shortcuts.\\n\\nGame play:\\nCo-op is incredible! It is fun to play with friends and have everyone just panicked where the enemies are coming from. There are times that the mobs are appearing from unexpected places like jumping from pipes, coming out of the airvents and being dropped by a plane. Stages are very challenging even with company. For Solo or Single player mode, I think it is impossible to defend the base by yourself especially on higher stages or higher difficulty. Death-match could use some more players allowed. \\n\\nOver all game play, I think this is very great and unique. Some improvements about balancing the game play, mob interaction, and player skills like dash, tumble or combos.\\n\\nGame Developers / Staffs:\\nStaffs are very welcoming! They are unbelievably responsive and helpful! So Thank you for being accommodating!\\n\\nOverall, I can say that this is a pretty decent game with a lot of potential! I am glad to have stumbled upon this game this early so I can witness the growth of the game! Me, my brother and his son has been enjoying playing this.

Maps are cool. \\nEdit to make my review more clear: So as of now, I would only ever use the sniper or the shotgun, Everything else has a crazy spread that just feels super bad and impossible to control. The flamethrower feels like it never ticks, even though i can clearly see flames taking up my entire screen. The auto rifle just feels like there is no accuracy to its shots, bursting doesnt seem to help, only seems ok at very close range, whats the point of that, you already have close range weapons. The gattling gun felt ok at point blank range, but at that point id rather use the shotgun. I dont have an opinion on the laser. Movement felt sluggish. The jumping and vaulting were fine, but in a game where the sniper is the only realistic weapon to use at a range, it feels like it takes ages to get into close range to do some real damage. Love the maps though.',\n",

       "   'review': \"[h1] Pure Nostalgia Overload! [/h1] \\n\\nI've been playing this game on the Nintendo Switch since launch, and was absolutely blown away by the level of detail and care that they (the developers Digital Cybercherries) put into it. This was even BEFORE I had joined their community on Discord (which is great btw)\\n\\nWith that said - reviewing this PC version is straight forward. The game is rock solid, runs fantastically, looks exponentially better than the Nintendo Switch version (which in itself was a feat to get running and looking well). I came in knowing the baseline of what to expect, but even that was exceeded by just simply playing it. \\n\\nThe first major difference I noticed was the additional details with regards to lighting and particle effects. Just absolutely gorgeous. It also runs easily at 60 fps on my aging Dell XPS 9550 (with a eGPU GTX 970). \\n\\nThere is also 4-player (up to) spit-screen mode - which is in itself a lost art. Playing with my buddies just threw me back 15 years to Halo days. There are modes for all to play - and even little 'party game' style games (Spinners mode and Tank battles).\\n\\nThe online mode is solid - there will no doubt be more servers playing up as this launch happens. \\n\\nHypercharge seriously makes me feel like my 80's kid self. I don't normally 'double-dip' into games on multiple platforms, but something compelled me to just do it. With the 1.0 official launch happening - it's an absolute MUST-HAVE game to own. It's a true sleeper-hit waiting in the wings.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'After a bad review with my first encounter of the game, I would like to sweep off the table..\\n\\nI was unable to play online due to my AV/firewall was blocking, I tried whitelisting which didn\\'t help, at last I disabled my AV/firewall and ran the game and steam as adminstrator and then it worked.... And booooy! I\\'m so glad it works, what a fun game!\\n\\nFirst of all, I love the concept and the whole idea. The way the developers use humor is next level :-D\\n\\nThe graphics goes perfect with the environment. I stopped several times fighting, just to admire the maps. All the maps I\\'ve tried so far, are really carried out well, and you really get the feeling of being a little sized figure in a really big world, which in perspective, is just a garden or a childsroom. \\nIt\\'s simply just brilliant, and I\\'d really really wish this game just had a \"id*ot-proof\" matchmaking system, like... Overwatch, or something... That would guarantee more players filling up the game modes, and make it way easier for newcomers, unfamiliar with creating/searching for game-lobbies. I know there is a \"automatic finder\"-function, but that\\'s not what I mean, I would like to see a queue-system, where you can optional choose to host the game, and get a bit more XP, or something like that, you could also then easy implement ranked.\\n\\nScore:\\n\\nGraphics - 9/10 - The graphics blend almost perfect with the whole idea of the game.\\n\\nMechanics (Only played co-op) - 8/10 - Nothing that you haven\\'t seen before, but they took the best parts of other co-op games and blend it together.\\n\\nSound - 8/10 - Really blends well with the environment, I personally turned down music, but that\\'s just me.\\n\\nAnimations/level design - 10/10 - The only thing I miss, which is totally unnecessary for the gameplay, is the possibility to interact with the objects/toys in the surroundings, like moving them or such, everything is just static objects. I\\'m thinking straight out of the box here, but you could maybe even make it possible to use some of the objects for your advantage. As an example, in the kitchen, there is abit of objects you can interact with, like vegetables and stuff, but what if I could use my grenade launcher to shoot at a carrot which goes into a horde, or push a book down the shelf, to a massive plastic crowd? \\n\\n---------------\\n\\nOverall: 9/10 - Would easily get a + point if they added queue system and ranked etc. and fixed the progression not being a locale save file, your profile should have some Cloudsync or server hosting.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Für mich eine Kaufempfehlung.\\n\\nDas Offensichtliche zuerst: Es ist ein schneller TD Shooter, den man natürlich am besten Coop spielt. Deathmatch konnte ich noch nicht ausprobieren, da ich kein Spiel gefunden hatte.\\n\\nDas Spiel ist der Kracher. Selten hatte ich so viel Spaß. Ein gutes Spiel findet auch vor allem im Kopf statt und mit der Vorstellung als Spielzeugsoldat durch übergroße Level zu hopsen und anderen Spielzeugen den Garaus zu machen, behagt mir doch sehr.\\n\\nDie Entwickler haben alles unternommen, um das Setting so stimmig wie möglich zu halten. Und hier liegt viel Herzblut im Detail. Easter Eggs überall. Von Filmpostern aus den Neunzigern bis zu witzigen Texten auf Shampooflaschen oder einer Motorradrennbahn mit einschlägiger Form, die Pen Island heißt. Irgendwo im Regal steht eine Schachtel mit einer Fantasy Burg, die an Castle Grayskull von Masters of the Universe erinnert. Ich kenne noch nicht alle Gegner, aber allein dass diese alten Spielzeugsoldaten von einem Bomber abgeworfen werden? Der Kracher.\\n\\nDas Leveldesign erinenrt an Sin von Ritual Entertainment mit dem berühmten Wohnzimmerlevel, manchmal vermisst man einen Grappling Hook, wobei dann vielleicht die Collectables, die überall in den Leveln versteckt sind, zu leicht zu erreichen wären.\\n\\nDas Potential, das die Grundthematik anbietet und zu ganz großen Teilen auch schon vorhanden ist, lässt in der Theorie zich möglichkeiten zu, was man noch implementieren könnte. Im Prinzip alles, was die Spielzeugindustire hergibt. Ich denke dabei auch an Exosuits, welche die Soldaten dann steuern könnten oder sogar Flugzeuge. Man könnte einen Race'N Shoot Modus kreieren. Auch hier erinnere ich mich an ein Spiel aus den Neunzigern, das Spielzeugautos durch Häuser fahren ließ.\\n\\nIch wünsche mir für das Spiel mehr Bekanntheit und dass die Devs nicht nachlassen. Vielleicht einen CTF Modus? :D \\n\\nNatürlich gibt es auch Negatives:\\n\\n-Ich habe keine Ahnung bezüglich der Spielmechanik, wie ich wissentlich und absichtlich einen kritischen Kill herbeiführen kann.\\n- Der Sprung auf Gassen-Mission (Alley Operation) zum Collectable auf dem Feuermelder ist ein @#!^%\",\n",

Unfortunately, from a developer’s perspective, the Steam forum offers not enough useful tools and is very clunky to navigate. It’s also incredibly slow when compared to Discord. We’ve also seen a much bigger, active and thriving community since the move.\\n\\nThere is genuinely nothing shady in us wanting to prioritise Discord. At its core, we sincerely want to create a better experience for our players, and we truly feel Discord provides that.\\n\\nI really hope my response has shed some light as to why we decided to use it.\\n\\nThanks again for the feedback and take care. :)'},\n",

A horde mode tower defense that you also play as a first person shooter, that is very reminiscent of small soldiers, toy story, and your general toys come to life story, save even more toy carnage then small soldiers had. Great gunplay, great enemy roster, and great ost. Has about ten levels right now, but is slated to get more/come out this year if I recall correctly so pick it up then if you rather wait for more content. I like what there is so far myself, given that this ten levels are highly replayable, and it is rather addicting to try and get all the unlockables. \\n\\nHaven't tried the coop, but I can only imagine it's pretty fun.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Hypercharge: Unboxed is one of the best examples of a co-op game out there. I consider it on my top three 'bro-ops' of the PC platform next to Deeprock Galactic and Risk of Rain 2.\\n\\nThe game takes the perspective of action figures and let's you run wild with a menagerie of weapon parts and massacre other toys with no reservations (or mercy). The aesthetic is slick, the music varies from fantastic to repetitive and the maps are arguably the best thing about the title. Climbing other toys, toyboxes and products with humorous placement text gild the levels from top to bottom. The perspective really makes you feel like a toy, which could arguably only be realized to such an effect degree in the first-person perspective.\\n\\nDespite the role you play, make no mistake! This isn't all fun and games, you can get your ass squarely kicked if you're having too much fun running around the map and not preparing your defenses. The game has a very distinct array of punishments for those who aren't focusing on the task, but has a Free Roam mode for those just enjoying the sights!\\n\\nGunplay? It's tight, but it can feel a bit punishing to be at the mercy of the spread of the basic weapon choices. This is why managing resources feels more rewarding, because the alternatives you can buy or find on the ground change the dynamic between you and your hapless, plastic victims.\\n\\nCustomization? This game has it in spades, from toy codename customizations (akin to call tags in Halo 3) and bodyparts you'll have a great time mashing together looks tailored around your most fickle desires. There's emblems too which is also pretty reminiscent of Halo, but they boast an alarming amount of emblems so take your time to look through them all! Skins for the bodyparts and guns? Yeah, there's a lot and most are as silly as you'd expect (in a good way).\\n\\nThe game boasts a set of tactical advantages other games don't- melee and reloading. These are your most important tools, and they function distinctly. Melee does damage and staggers the enemy, and your weapons can reload while you melee and swap to use your other gun! Very subtle- but very powerful options. \\n\\nClimbing is the most finnicky thing to get used to, so take the time to learn how you control your jumps and managing your height relation to ledges so you can pull yourself up!\",\n",

       "   'review': 'This game is a love letter to fans of the old Army Men games that had multiplayer, toy collectors, fans of Sanctum/Sanctum 2, and just anyone that misses games that are just a blast to play without drama or greed. It\\'s enjoyable solo or in multiplayer. I love the customization options for the figures, weapons, and even your randomly generated, in-game name. It\\'s not perfect, but I\\'ll be damned if it isn\\'t damned near close for me.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n☑ The feel of the game, between the shooting, high mobility, and the tower defense aspects, is just spectacular. The action mixed-in with moments of planning (and taking a breath) are perfectly paced depending on what difficulty you choose.\\n☑ It looks great. It strikes a perfect balance between semi-realistic and stylized.\\n☑ It\\'s nice to have a game with decent amounts of customization without wanting to nickel and dime you for cash-shop cosmetics.\\n☑ The enemies, maps, and modes (current and upcoming) are varied enough to keep things from getting stale.\\n☑ The nods (easter eggs) to existing things are pretty cool. Never thought I\\'d see knock-off Boglins on anything other than a Jim Sterling video.\\n\\nCons\\n\\n☒ Multiplayer matches are sometimes hard to find unless you have friends, play locally, or know what times to get on to find strangers (or new friends?). The game is still fun solo, but here\\'s to hoping the population picks up after the recent Switch release and upcoming updates still to come.\\n\\n☒ A few (and I mean VERY FEW) balancing issues need addressing. For example, the flamethrower has very little reach and I feel like it is very situational, at best, to use. Turrets could possibly use a buff just in general (IE - targeting, frequency of attack, and health points).\\n\\nOverall, I sincerely LOVE this game and wish I hadn\\'t kept it wishlisted for so long before buying it. It\\'s just a blast to play, plain and simple. I\\'d give it a 4.5/5. People that aren\\'t as obsessed with toys as I am, but like this \"genre\" of game would probably give it a 4/5. If this game can find a bigger audience, it has the polish and gameplay to really become one of the top games to play on Steam. Do yourself a favor and get it if you\\'re even remotely on the fence.',\n",

Man sieht die Liebe und Leidenschaft der Entwickler in so vielen Details der liebevoll gestalteten Maps.\\n\\n----\\n\\nWorum geht es? \\nMan startet als Team (schlimmstenfalls alleine) auf einer Map und hat die Aufgabe Gold zu sammeln. Auf der Map befinden sich 3 Punkte, welche verteidigt werden müssen. Die Auswahl an möglichen Waffen/Fallen für die Verteidigung fallen vielseitig aus und bieten gute Möglichkeiten Taktisch zu verteidigen. Nach einem Countdown wechselt das Spiel vom Bau-Modus in die Ego-Shooter-Mechanik und die erste Welle rollt an. Nun gilt es in klassischer Ego-Shooter-Manier die Gegner davon abzuhalten, die Punkte zu verteidigen. \\n\\n----\\n\\nWas nicht gefällt:\\nDie Playerbase ist leider sehr überschaubar. Daher hier ein Tipp: Schnappt euch einen/mehrere Freund/e und spielt es zusammen. So macht Hypercharge Unboxed am meisten Spass!\\nAuch das die Towers keine Upgrademöglichkeit besitzen ist echt schade. Klasse vor Masse zu spielen in einem Tower Defense ist daher nicht möglich. Es ist immer die Masse die zählt. Hier hätte ich mir gewünscht, dass jeder Tower mit 3 Upgradestufen versehen ist (was ja eigentlich Genrestandard währe). \\nEbenfalls sind einige Gegner (je nach Map) schwer erkennbar. Auch sind es einige Tower, welche die Gegner fast unsichtbar machen und so schwer zu erkennen sind. \\n\\n----\\n\\nHypercharge Unboxed kann ich jedem empfehlen, der sowohl mit Tower Defense, als auch mit Ego-Shootern was anfangen kann. Das unverbrauchte Setting bietet viele kreative Einfälle und Lacher (man beachte die Verpackungen die herumliegen!). Taktisches Vorgehen ist zu empfehlen - daher ist es von Vorteil sich abzusprechen und Aufgaben klar zu verteilen. Es gibt vieles zum erspielen (diverse Skins und Maps) \\n\\nAlles in allem ein tolles Preis/Leistungs-Packet! Ich hoffe sehr, dass mehr Spieler Hypercharge Unboxed anschauen werden und bleiben.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   'review': 'Hidden Gem.  \\n\\nI heard someone say this was a great local 4 player split-screen fps.  That alone got my attention.  Sick of playing online with strangers.\\n\\nWhat\\'s this game like?  How to sum it up... basically you have a sandbox fps done in the style of \"toy soldiers come to life and have toy guns that shoot high velocity pellets in your kitchen that\\'s full of stuff for cover and parkour.\"  Feels more like Halo than CoD.  Game modes currently are waves (defend the base solo or w/ friends), deathmatch (free-for-all or team), and plague (zombie tag).  \\n\\nDoes it play well?  Yes.  It\\'s faster paced than what you might think.  You can sprint, double jump, and grab edges to climb up.  Maps allow for parkour and are both beautiful and tactical.  \\n\\nI had an intense moment where I was being chased by 2 zombies, and I had to parkour to get away.  I couldn\\'t just turn around and shoot because they were too close.  Zombies will catch you because you cannot sprint backwards.  This is a fun, skill based formula and the highlight of the game for me.  \\n\\nDrawbacks?  No bots for deathmatch and zombie tag.  Would absolutely love bots for those game modes.  Devs, if you\\'re reading this, please consider adding bots to deathmatch and zombie tag.\\n\\nAlso, I did had some issues with lag across 3 computers connected via lan but it seldom happened. \\n\\nThings I\\'d like to see: aiming down the sights, able to crouch, more gamemodes and maps and bots. There\\'s a lot the devs could add to this game but maybe simpler is better.\\nAnd about weapon attachments, it\\'s not something you unlock and keep.  It\\'s more like you find it mid game and use it until you die.  That\\'s fine for this formula.  And the progression that you do unlock and keep is all cosmetic, as far as I know.  Just thought I\\'d mention that.\\n\\nIn comparison to other fps games, it\\'s more family friendly than CoD and I like that.  Local 4 player split-screen coop is awesome and something you don\\'t see much anymore.  And you can customize the appearance of all 4 players and I believe it saves the cosmetic unlocks for everyone.  And if you want to do lan, it does that too.  Want to lan with 4 players on one computer and another computer with 4 players?  Well. You. Can!  Currently 9 maps for deathmatch and zombies (10 for waves).  And all for $20, yeah this is a good deal.  You have $20, buy it lol.',\n",

       "   'review': \"I have been following this game for a while, and finally decided to pick it up.  It is worth every penny.  The game plays great, feels great, and looks fantastic.  I have just as much fun exploring every inch of the map, as I do fighting the waves of enemies.  The feeling of being so small, and traversing something that feels so big, yet so real, is like no other game I have played.  Climbing to the very top of the map, and eventually jumping all the way down, is fantastic.  That feeling of landing, and the visual feedback when you land a high jump, feels just right.  \\nThen there is the shooting, which feels just right.  Enough punch that your guns feel good, and the attachments have enough to them to make the guns feel stronger.  This game is everything I was hoping for, yet I'm surprised how much better it feels than I was expecting.  \\n\\nAs for the negatives, this game could use more content.  As it is, the maps get repetitive.  You always fight the same waves of enemies, in the same order.  I would love for the waves to be a bit more random, as it would greatly increase replayability.  This game is built for co-op, and it would be awesome to play with 4 players on the harder difficulties.  However, there is no player base at the moment, and I have never found an online match to join, or had anyone join my lobby.  I don't have any friends on steam to play this game with, so this is unfortunate.  \\n\\nSo in short, this game is special.  It plays and feels like no other game I have played.  It needs more content, and more variety to keep it from getting repetitive, but what is here now is well worth the money.  If you have friends that will buy it and play it, then go for it.  If you plan to play solo, it is still worth it, but the highest difficulties require a teammate. \\n\\nFor now I will play it with my 8 year old son, and we are having a blast.  Great job, Digital Cybercherries.  Please keep the content coming!\\n\\n\",\n",

NOT THE CASE IF U WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME FULLY COMPLETE ALL OBJECTIVES.in this early version because i heard its releasing the 31st. Also since no problem by anyone that theres no players so im forced to singleplayer im sure like most right now, i have seen some more enemie variation the ai is not as bad as i thought noticing the behavior of the head shot off, and when they drop from the ledges its pretty realistic even with all my settings turned on also alot of people stink on this games climbing and its phenomenal especially how i didnt fall easily also there should be more outside maps or some at carnivals pitball places etc. so far i love the asthetics the eastereggs please keep those up and the details are beautiful the game runs beautiful after updates, also the optimization customization is really phenomanal. i tested this game both my laptop low spec and high spec computer and it ran very smoothly i kinda hope the game runs this smoothly especially it being a split scrren game also playing with family is very fun and nastolgic. gameplay its pretty fun not bare as people say graphics is very mindblowing at times and i will say that the customization is pretty damn good but hope there will be more considering where we are at an age at 2020 gaming. i cant wait for the 31st and i will continue supporting the devs especiallythe consistency and integrity that they perform when working on this game was very skeptical at first but give it a chance realize its early access lack of player and u got a treasure no ones ever tackled toystory and call of duty lol. give it a shot.',\n",

I understand the playerbase is very low, but whilst in Early Access, our priority is to focus on the quality of the game. It’s very important the game is super polished for full release.

       "   'review': \"Even in it's early state, this is seriously one of my new favorite games. Just a really solid co-op shooter. I love being able to mow down waves of killer Beyblades and tiny green army men with a minigun that shoots airsoft pellets. I love how giant and detailed the maps are, they are waaay more beautiful than they have any right to be, and have easter eggs and collectables scattered around to reward exploration. With a little bit of extra content and balance changes, I also think the PVP could be worth the price of admission alone, if that's your thing. But most of all, being an immature manchild who has a thing for old toys, I absolutely love the theme. It's kind of like if Microvolts was a tower defense game, and, you know, not complete garbage.\\n\\nThe only real issues I can think of with the gameplay are the weird floaty movement, which isn't too bad but it can take a bit of getting used to and could use some tweaking, and the surprising spikes in difficulty. Even on the lower difficulty levels, the later maps can be brutal without an experienced teammate or two, especially if you're going for higher ranks like Platinum and above.\\n\\nIf what you've seen has peaked your interest at all, I implore you, buy it now. Buy it for a friend too, because the worst thing about this game right now is the lack of players, and it's a damn shame that a hidden gem like this is being overlooked. DCC has created something special here.\",\n",

We want the game to be consistent with its theme of being living toys. You are a pint-sized action figure, traversing the environment when you’re that small in comparison to your surroundings, should feel different to that of being life-sized. We may not have the jumping mechanics perfect, but we’ll continue to monitor player feedback and see if we can make any small adjustments. :)\\n\\nOnce again, we really appreciate the time you’ve taken to write this.

Still though, if the devs plan on releasing more quality content like this in the future, I would definitely not refuse!\\n\\nEver wanted to play a first person, horde-mode (or pvp) shooter with platforming elements, but set in a universe reminicent to Toy Story or Small Soldiers (god I feel old now)? Well, this game has you covered!\\n\\nFrom the funny references to the cleanly flowing gameplay to the deliciously dripping toy theme, this game delivers in many more ways than I anticipated and I personally cant wait what the devs might add in the future. \\n\\nI do have 2 little pieces of constructive critisism though if the devs are interested. \\n\\n1. I think the game is doing itself a disservice with the game\\'s title. Even though I like the idea of there beijg a toyline called \"Hypercharge\", I don\\'t really think it reaches out to the (right) target audience. I, for one, have been looking for a game like this for a long time, but found this one merely by accident and excessively digging through steam\\'s library of games. I guess \"Hypercharge\" isn\\'t really a tag that pops quickly on people\\'s radar. \\n\\n2. I love playing the game and enjoy unlocking the plentiful amount of cosmetic content, but I do think the game is a bit overly restrictive on the \"unlockables\" department. You dont really start out with any options to customize your character and I think that could potentially scare way players who just want to jump in and immediately have a fun casual time with friends.',\n",

Una ventaja salientable es que es compatible tanto con modalidades online como con juego local.

       "   'review': \"Very good CO-OP tower defense game with interesting FPS elements, this game is also good looking and has great attention to detail in its level design. Some buildables are over-powered while others are under-powered, however, that is to be expected of an early access game.\\n\\nBut I would like to bring attention to some serious game/connectivity issues me and a friend have been having online, for example, the game enemies sometimes go very fast and instantly attack the cores within a few seconds and a game over occurs, or they go so slow that it makes an Expert difficulty match extremely easy to complete with a Diamond award.\\n\\nOther game/connectivity issues include randomly not being able to jump, jump pads not being interactive and randomly disconnecting from the server.\\n\\nAnother issue is that the Beyblade style enemies are very powerful and hard to stop. When all goes well on a cohesive Expert playthrough of a map, these Beyblade enemies spawn and instantly melt your core's shields and damages health without giving you much of a chance to react. The main problem is that they can glitch through buildable walls and drop from vents directly on top of a core, instantly damaging them before you could even destroy them. They spawn in too many numbers and they are the only enemy in this game that feels truly unfair. \\n\\nAnother problem is the dropship, their turrets like to shoot down one particular core, melting their shield down in no time preventing you from getting a Diamond award. This is a problem because you and your friends cannot kill one fast enough before they do that. However the dropships only tend to be a problem on the garden map with the red core.\\n\\nOn the plus side though, this game is very fun and completely unique. There is not another game of this kind. If you like rats style maps on CSS/CSGO or TF2 or you have played one of those old Tower Defense flash games, then do yourself a favour and play this game.\",\n",

Gludo is extremely effective as it essentially stops them from moving / spinning. Expert mode is meant to be very difficult and challenging, especially if you’re after the highest tier reward. It’s all about trial and error, and testing to see which tactic works best. \\n\\n[quote]5. - The main problem is that they can glitch through buildable walls and drop from vents directly on top of a core, instantly damaging them before you could even destroy them.

However the dropships only tend to be a problem on the garden map with the red core.[/quote]\\nRemember to always have an anti-air turret ready when on a map that has the cargo plane. I have seen others mention this before though, so will definitely bring up to the rest of the team.\\n\\nOnce again thank you so much for giving us your suggestions. We sincerely appreciate it and will of course look into the issues you have experienced. We are still in Early Access and are doing our best to develop the game based on community feedback. Thank you and take care. :)\"},\n",

       "   'review': 'There is Early Access and then there is development hell Early Access.  Currently this could easily be released today and be 100% better than some other full games out there.  I would put this in the category with Deep Rock Galactic early access run.  The only thing it lacks is more of it. That being said this isn\\'t barebones with ten levels, multiple enemies, and lots of unlockable cosmetics.\\n\\nShort Review: If it looks fun to you I would say get it.  I bought it on a whim (mainly due to the aesthetics) and I have been having fun.  If you like horde/tower defense gameplay as well as exploring huge rooms as an action figure then give it a shot.\\n\\nGushing Long Review: All I can say, #1 is the art style is 1000% on point.  There is so much attention to detail everywhere!  All of the plastic looks like molded plastic.  I ran into a random garlic clove in the bedroom and I spent a minute just looking over the details.  So many games in the last few years have tried to do the nostalgia of old toys, but they never get the idea right.  Two examples that work so well here is when you spawn in, you burst out of your packaging.  Additional weaponry is even attached to these boxes.  The other example is players don\\'t have player names, they have toy names, like Dr. Punch Man. Which is all selectable in the customization screen.\\n\\nIt would be one thing to have a level full of cool details everywhere, but have no reason to look at it.  Some games (I\\'m thinking of For Honor right now) have loads of detail but all of the gameplay is hyper focused in a small area.  Hypercharge is different because each building round you need to get money that is littered around the room.  So each new round you will want to explore new shelves, around boxes, and in the rafters for all the money and unlockables.  More money means better defenses and more unlockables means more customization.\\n\\nLevels are large, but (as far as I have gotten) not hard to manage. Typically there is one defense point that is out in the open, another one that is slightly less visible, and one that is usually out of the way with less defenses. Most fights start with a focus on the main one, then bump up to the first two, and by the third round you are getting sneaky enemies attacking the third.  I have been playing solo and it\\'s doable but the garage was the first mission I just gave up on one node to focus on the other two.  The game can be soloed but there are definitely advantages to having more players.\\n\\nI\\'m sort of blathering on at this point so here are my two major highlights so far.  In the second story level the game spawned in green army men.  Here is what I\\'m talking about with aesthetics.  The army men aren\\'t green soldiers, they are army men with flat mountings on their feet, so to approach you they have to hop!  It\\'s kind of horrifying in a way, even more so because these are the first enemies that have ranged attacks.  So the round starts and I hear a weird diesel engine sound.  Must be an ambient truck noise (I forgot to mention there is some good sound design too).  Then I see one of those classic green tanks that usually come with green army men.  This is followed by out of control green jeeps and finally a huge bomber flying overhead.  The floor is littered with still army men and the bomber is dropping parachute men.  It\\'s chaos, but I\\'m having a blast.\\n\\nThe other moment is just the simple joy that the action playset (with clearly defined \"Battle Damage TM\" window) is something you can actually use for cover.  \\n\\nCons: MOAR everything!  The game is great, but more stuff would just make it better. My only other criticism is I think it would be cool if you could interact with the environment.  Like stepping on the keyboard changes the screen or if you step on that plate in the playset the \"Battle Damage TM\" window blows out.  Maybe things like that could be triggered to do damage to enemies or block paths.\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to see what will be next for HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed!',\n",

       "   'review': \"I don't generally enjoy leaving reviews, as a matter of fact this is my very first steam review to any of the games that I own. However with this game being in early access I felt that I should at least do my part and tell anyone having doubts whether they should buy this game or wait until its full release - just as I was. And let me tell you that you absolutely should buy it now if this is the type of game that you enjoy. And here is why:\\n\\nCONTENT:\\nThe game is full of it - The principle is simple enough, you have to defend your cores. But it's how you do it that will really keep you going - which traps to lay down and in which position, where should you position yourself for quick access to all cores, where should you invest your coins - a trap, a jumping platform or a weapon upgrade. These strategies will lead you to a gold or even platinum medal (standard difficulty) if you are able to use your resources appropriately. \\n\\ntl;dr - If you are concerned with content I can assure you that it isn't lacking and you will have as much fun as any other fully released game in this genera. \\n\\nMAPS: \\nBecause the game is in early access and more maps may be added I will not say exactly how many are currently available, but it's the same quantity and size than any other AAA FPS game. The maps are very cleverly laid out and really make you plan and outline a way to get to all cores in time for a quick response.\\n\\nSINGLE V MULTI-PLAYER\\nI have played in both modes and honestly I felt no difference between the two modes, both are very fun and because the game balances the difficult of the level based on you being solo or paying with a friend it never feels unfair.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE: \\nThe games runs very smoothly and it never crashed on me once, I run this game at a consistent 144fps and I never had a dip even in intensive battles where a lot of enemies are in one location, if you are especially picky with the performance of your games then I can assure you that this game won't let you down.\\n\\nWILL YOU HAVE FUN?:\\nOBVIOUSLY! If you love fast paced and action filled games then this game is loads of fun!\\n\\nFINALLY:\\nMassive thanks to the devs -  the artwork is absolutely amazing and the game runs buttery smooth and you can tell by a mile that this game had and still has a lot of love put into it. With the amount of crappy games coming out its great to see such a good title being on steam.\\n\\nFINALLY FINALLY - Please to the devs if they are listening - please don't take an epic exclusive for your full release, without steam I couldn't even be writing this review! \\n\\n\",\n",

       "   'review': 'EDIT: I stand by everything I stated below, but after the devs\\' response to this and ensuing conversations on their Discord, I feel this is a passionate, responsive team willing to put in the effort to take this game to the level it can be. I want to do what I can to support that and encourage their ongoing efforts.\\n\\nThis game has all the starting assets for being a GREAT game. It\\'s almost a great Tower Defense, it almost has great gun mechanics, it almost has fun enemies.... so what\\'s wrong?\\n\\nTL;DR I know game development is hard. I don\\'t want to put down the devs, but every problem in this game pretty much just feels like lack of attention to the sauce of things. They have all the ingredients, but there\\'s no harmony in the mix and in it\\'s current state, the gameplay just falls off as a dissatisfying time suck.\\n\\n1) Balancing. EVERYTHING.\\n1a) Only bullet-based weaponry is useful. You can forget using the cool laser or the grenade launcher. The launcher won\\'t kill even the weakest enemies with one hit if it isn\\'t direct.\\n1b) Enemy waves. Beyblades. I\\'m a veteran gamer. I\\'m not incredible but I\\'m good at most games. Even with another person Beyblades kill at least one brain tower thingy every round. Why are there SO. MANY. (Again you can forget the grenade launcher actually being useful for this scenario.) Why are the exploding blobs SO. GATDANG. POWERFUL.\\n1c) Time spent platforming. 60-70% of this game is platforming for tokens and collectables and then a quick spritz of defense before more platforming. Which is fine I guess, but you really need these if you want to make good defensesーwhich brings me to my last subpoint.\\n1d) Scarcity. I\\'m all for earning upgrades, fighting hard, etc etc. Hyoercharge takes it too far. By the time you actually have anything cool set up, it\\'s the last round and there\\'s no satiating sense of acheivement.\\n\\n2) This is a wave based defense game with defense towers, but they\\'re just....bad. The towers feel infrequent and disconnected from a particularly legitimate (or at least entertaining/exciting) defense setup. Rockets are too slow and machine gun towers take up too much battery. Towers need more \"oomf\" in usefulness, visuals, even their high cost and placement in the game makee them feel a little secondary. They\\'re just kind of an underwhelming piece. They need more dynamic placements, they need to shoot more/look cooler, they need to die slower and have stronger places out of reach by ground troops.\\n\\n3) Small detailsーit\\'s a conglomerate of things making this game such an \"almost\" experience. The smash landing deals no damage. The bullet physics are hit scan even though they look otherwise. The towers don\\'t have great variety of placement options outside of RIGHT next to objectives and a couple wall setups. The reload system of switching between weapons seems cool, but feels repetitious and a little unrefined in actual gameplay. Wish there was a better way of knowing where enemies will show up, as well as where they are on the map.\\n\\n4) Pacing. Everything. Takes. One hundred. Years. Every upgrade, every purchase, every hiatus between rounds (admittedly optional, but necessary to a moderately annoying degree if you\\'re picking up points.) All of it. This is a light game to pick up and have fun with for an hour or two with friends. I do not want to spend my life grinding levels.',\n",

Right, I\\'ll do my best to respond to your feedback, good sir! \\n\\n[quote]1.a - Balancing. EVERYTHING. Only bullet-based weaponry is useful. You can forget using the cool laser or the grenade launcher. The launcher won\\'t kill even the weakest enemies with one hit if it isn\\'t direct.[/quote]\\nOur initial idea with the Grenade launcher was to give it splash damage and in return, it throws back the enemy. This does help you protect the HYPER-CORE. However, it\\'s not actually a practical way, and most players look past it. In our next patch, the Grenade launcher will explode your foes into tiny pieces.\\n\\n[Quote]1.b - Enemy waves. Beyblades. I\\'m a veteran gamer. I\\'m not incredible but I\\'m good at most games. Even with another person Beyblades kill at least one brain tower thingy every round. Why are there SO. MANY. (Again you can forget the grenade launcher actually being useful for this scenario.) Why are the exploding blobs SO. GATDANG. POWERFUL. .[/quote]\\nWhat difficulty was this on? Also, in case you didn\\'t know, placing a battery into a Power node gives the HYPER-CORE a shield, allowing it to soak up some damage. As for the blobs, and all enemy types, we\\'re constantly tweaking and changing them. Nothing is currently set in stone.\\n\\n[quote]1.c - Time spent platforming. 60-70% of this game is platforming for tokens and collectables and then a quick spritz of defense before more platforming.

Right now, we are experimenting with the number of buildcredits you are given to help us find out what works best. It’s trial and error at this stage in development, but I appreciate you bringing it up.\\n\\n[quote]2. - This is a wave based defense game with defense towers, but they\\'re just....bad.

They need more dynamic placements, they need to shoot more/look cooler, they need to die slower and have stronger places out of reach by ground troops.[/quote]\\nIn some of our recent updates, we have allowed more placements to build Turrets. What we struggle with in the TD aspect of things, is that Unboxed is a hybrid between wave-based shooting and tower defense. It’s not solely focussed on building towers. However, that doesn’t mean we can’t find a happy medium to suite our player base. I’ll talk to the team regarding your points here and see what we can come up with. \\n\\n[quote] 3. - Small detailsーit\\'s a conglomerate of things making this game such an \"almost\" experience.

Wish there was a better way of knowing where enemies will show up, as well as where they are on the map.[/quote]\\n\\n[quote] 3.a - The smash landing deals no damage.[/quote]\\nWe have tested the game with fall damage on in the past. It became quite frustrating to lose health or even fall to your death from the highest points, given how frequently you are jumping. With that said, we could possibly add fall damage as an option when creating a server?\\n\\n[quote]3.b - The bullet physics are hit scan even though they look otherwise.[/quote]\\nOur bullet damage is done with an instant trace, but we show a fake BB, for style. Some people don\\'t like it, and others do not notice. We hope to improve the disparity in the future. :)\\n\\n[quote]3.c - The towers don\\'t have great variety of placement options outside of RIGHT next to objectives and a couple wall setups.[/quote]\\nWe’ll see if we can possibly add some placements further away from the objective to make the game more appealing to TD fans. Originally, Unboxed allowed you to build your defenses pretty much anywhere on the floor surface. But this made the gameplay very repetitive in terms of how the enemy traverse. Again, it’s a matter of getting that happy medium, it just takes time.\\n\\n[quote]3. d - The reload system of switching between weapons seems cool, but feels repetitious and a little unrefined in actual gameplay[/quote]\\nAny ideas with what we could do different? I’d love to hear them! :)\\n\\n[quote]3.e - Wish there was a better way of knowing where enemies will show up, as well as where they are on the map.[/quote]\\nThere is an indicator that shows you where the last remaining enemies are. The problem with knowing where the enemies will show up, is that it takes a lot of the danger away. We want you to be on edge throughout the beginning of each wave.\\n\\n[quote] 4. - Pacing. Everything. Takes. One hundred. Years. Every upgrade, every purchase, every hiatus between rounds (admittedly optional, but necessary to a moderately annoying degree if you\\'re picking up points.) All of it. This is a light game to pick up and have fun with for an hour or two with friends. I do not want to spend my life grinding levels.[/quote]\\nI’ll talk with the rest of the team and see if we can somehow pick up the speed regarding progression. I understand that to some players such as yourself, it may become a chore.\\n\\nDuring our time in Early Access, many things will change and be altered. Nothing is permanent. That’s the beauty of EA, it allows us to test and try many mechanics. Thank you again for providing all your feedback. It helps us out tremendously so that we may further improve the game. If you have any more suggestions, It’d be awesome to have you on our [url=https://discordapp.com/invite/hyperchargeunboxed]Discord.[/url] Take care!\\n\\n'},\n",

Its immediate charm is apparent, but underneath its terrific visual style is a challenging co-op shooter, with an incredible wealth of customization options. \\n\\nA common problem with even the best \"Early Access\" games is that they feel unfinished or light on content. While the latter could be argued for this game, that is only because the customization is so rewarding and is a standout feature. \\n\\nI can see \"HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed\" rivaling \"Fortnite,\" with seasons of unlockables and content. \\n\\nThe foundation is strong enough that I suspect the only thing truly holding this game back is a larger budget. \\n\\nWell done.\\n\\nNow we just need more.',\n",

Hugely recommend if you have friends to play with and work together, heaps of fun. Hoping there is some changes for solo play AI bots or just some sort of assistance.

       "   'review': \"I haven't played much Hypercharge yet, but I can already tell that this game has the potential to become something very, very special. The developers have done something really difficult here in managing to capture a true childhood-like experience of just playing with our toys and upscaling it into a grand battle that is both beautiful and funny. Kudos.\\n\\nStuff that I love about this game:\\n- No microtransactions. Thank you for not being evil.\\n- Map design and variety. \\n- Tons of stuff to unlock. Buildables, skins, maps, even new names in the name generator.\\n- The name generator itself is a delight. \\n- The off-brands. Just reading the labels on all of the various props around has been cracking me up. I wish my speed stick had 24 hour Hodor protection.\\n- The music. Great soundtrack with a perfect 80's vibe. I hope more tracks continue to be added!\\n- The level of nostalgia that this game sets off is incredible.\\n- Challenges and Collectibles for added objectives each map. \\n\\nThings that need improvement:\\n- As I write this, only one game mode exists. Coop defense vs waves of enemies. It's fun, but I could see it getting stale after a while, especially once you've collected all of the unlockables. But considering a drop-down menu for game modes exists in the menu, I have to assume that more modes are planned for the future.\\n- The weapon system could use improvement. Attachments are unclear as how they effect you (ex: different optics simply say things like +1 accuracy, but in a game where there is no aiming down sights and only a zoom-in-effect, I have no idea if accuracy means an improved zoom effect, decreased spread, recoil reduction, sway, or what. There's also no indicator for how much +1 is vs nothing or +2, or any comparison with a currently equipped attachment of the same slot). Weapon variety itself is a bit low, but a new weapon was just patched in today, so again my hope is that this is being worked on already.\\n- The machine gun is awful. If it's going to be less accurate and do less damage than the regular rifle, it can't also have a smaller mag. Give that thing at least 60 rounds.\\n- Enemy variety. I absolutely love the enemies that exist (the spinning crossfire death discs might be a bit too strong) but I would love to see more knock-offs of different toys coming in to attack. A bit of randomization to some waves might be nice as well.\\n- Shop inventories. While I love the way that shops are set up as attachments that come in the toy's box, it's a little awkward trying to mouse over every little object to see if it's anything useful or not. I think a shopping menu that you can access at the boxes might be more intuitive. It could also let us sell unwanted attachments for more cash/building coin.\",\n",

Mix of casual to unlock stuff and higher difficulties played.\\n\\n-Graphics are honestly a great part about the game, I am amazed at the attention to detail in the maps, characters and enemies. It is very creative and enjoyable.\\n-The gameplay is pretty solid but the mechanics need tweaking. The parkour and jumping is a fantastic idea, but the vaulting onto objects is very inconsistent. You know you should make a jump but it won't let you onto the ledge for no reason.\\n-The maps are well made and for the most part are pretty good in design, however toy palace has so many irregular ledges and edges, that despite an object appearing slanted or angled they should just make the actual ledge flat or add an invisible wall. It makes jumping around on the map excessively difficult. \\n             Another map that I found had issues is evil garden, the planes at the end just glitch and disappear. Me and my friend were trying to finish the wave but the plane was gone and eventually showed up flying backwards out of the roof. The trex also only attacked 2 turrets and kept getting stuck. \\n-The AI seem to spawn focused on one objective and do not switch targets even if there movement is inhibited, such as they fall off a ledge and can't get back up.\\n-Weapons are fun, and I hope they add more. The only thing is the lack of attachment spawns, as it is hard to buy attachments and maintain towers and defenses.\\n-Currency is good, but they need to give the currency to the player automatically upon killing the enemy, similar to Call of Duty Zombies. Or currency per X damage dealt. Overall it just seems to be  a lack of currency for most maps and its either buy towers or weapons, not both.\\n-Wave spawns, it is not the worse they could have but they could definitely be improved. It would be great if they told you what type of enemy will be spawning next. Also a enemy counter instead of a wave bar. Some enemies take up a huge amount of the bar and its a really bad judge of how many enemies are actually left.\\n\\nFor early access, the game is very playable and enjoyable. It really needs tweaking here and there as the overall concept is done pretty well. I have only played with friends but the game is fun and on higher difficulty really adds to the intensity.\",\n",

We're thankful players such as yourself take the time to help us better development Unboxed.\\n\\n[quote]1. The parkour and jumping is a fantastic idea, but the vaulting onto objects is very inconsistent. You know you should make a jump but it won't let you onto the ledge for no reason.[/quote]\\nNot to avoid what you’ve stated, but we have recently updated the vaulting system. Climbing isn’t 100% consistent, there is timing and skill to it. However, I have seen this mentioned a few times even after the update. I will talk to the rest of the team and see what we can do. :)\\n\\n[quote]2. however toy palace has so many irregular ledges and edges, that despite an object appearing slanted or angled they should just make the actual ledge flat or add an invisible wall. It makes jumping around on the map excessively difficult.[/quote]\\nSome ledges are slanted as a design choice. You can slide down them to try and reach other spots. It adds to the parkour aspect of the game. I’ll have a look myself in-game to see if some areas are too difficult to climb. \\n\\n[quote]3. Another map that I found had issues is evil garden, the planes at the end just glitch and disappear. Me and my friend were trying to finish the wave but the plane was gone and eventually showed up flying backwards out of the roof. The trex also only attacked 2 turrets and kept getting stuck.[/quote]\\nI’ve noted this down and we’ll look into ASAP. The T-Rex is a WIP. We’ll keep updating it and make sure it doesn’t get stuck. My apologies for any frustration.\\n\\n[quote]4. The AI seem to spawn focused on one objective and do not switch targets even if there movement is inhibited, such as they fall off a ledge and can't get back up.[/quote]\\nWhen you say they fall off an edge and can’t get back up, do they just stand there and don’t move? Will bring this up with the rest of the team.\\n\\n[quote]5. The only thing is the lack of attachment spawns, as it is hard to buy attachments and maintain towers and defenses.[/quote]\\nHigher difficulty modes give a higher chance to find attachments. What difficulty were you playing on? I’ll also mention this with the team and see if more players are saying the same thing. \\n\\n[quote]6. Currency is good, but they need to give the currency to the player automatically upon killing the enemy, similar to Call of Duty Zombies. Or currency per X damage dealt. Overall it just seems to be a lack of currency for most maps and its either buy towers or weapons, not both.[/quote]\\nWe recently updated the game which contained a ton of re-balancing. When you kill enemies, they drop coins. There are more credits and coins around the environment. We’ve also lowered the cost of all attachments and turrets. During our Early Access phase, we’ll continue to re-balance the game according to player feedback. :)\\n\\n[quote]7. Wave spawns, it is not the worse they could have but they could definitely be improved. It would be great if they told you what type of enemy will be spawning next. Also a enemy counter instead of a wave bar. Some enemies take up a huge amount of the bar and its a really bad judge of how many enemies are actually left.[/quote]\\nWe wouldn’t like to give away what enemies you are going to be up against. It takes away the element of surprise.  We’ll look into altering the wave bar. :)\\n\\nThanks again for your feedback. As I always say; we’re developing the game with you, the players. Keep up the good work with your suggestions. Full release, here we come!\"},\n",

So long as the shields are active and taking the damage, you can still earn the higher tier rewards. If the shields are not active and then take damage, you will not earn the highest tier reward. \\n\\n[quote]2. - The waves start ludicrously easy for the first two, then you get spinner-rushed and a decent wave size finale.[/quote]\\nIt depends what difficulty mode you are playing. As with other traditional TD games, we try to build up momentum. As you progress through each wave, it becomes more chaotic and overall difficult. We are of course constantly trying to improve the gameplay to make sure it’s re-playable and fun. Most of our players enjoy the current system, the response we’ve received thus far has been very positive.  But if we are to find more complaints such as yours crop up, we’ll investigate seeing what needs to be changed.\\n\\n[quote]3. - I had no idea that parkour was going to be the meat of this game, and it's also very rusty. There's a double jump and a weird mantle that works 60% of the time.[/quote]\\nWe recently improved the vaulting system to make climbing easier for new players. Please see the full path notes [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/523660/announcements/detail/1595878665971941583/]here.[/url] Bear in mind that climbing is not meant to be 100% accurate. There is skill and timing to it. However, we will be looking into this and will see if more players are still having such issues.\\n\\n[quote]4. - When I thought 'epic battles defending a base against waves of toys', I didn't think I'd be chasing coins all around the map for 3 minutes in a panic trying to outrun my teammates so I could get a weapon upgrade that does nothing.[/quote]\\nThis is called build-mode. It gives the player a chance to explore and appreciate the environment, as well as search for collectables. You do not have to wait for 3 minutes. Should you feel you’re prepared for the next wave, press F to skip build-mode. Weapon attachments have their own attribute. Hovering over them will show text indicating what the benefits are.\\n\\n[quote]5. - Then there's the 'base building' which is just placing generic traps within a sanctioned 5m radius around the objective...which is not how I ever play tower or base defense games.[/quote]\\nHYPERCHARGE: Unboxed is not a dedicated TD game. It’s a hybrid between wave-based-shooting. We are trying to make the building side of things appeal more to TDS fans. What would you like to see different?\\n\\n[quote]6. - The only viable weapons I've found are the shotgun and minigun. The grenade launcher takes forever to load, and the feeling of striking a robot directly in between his shoulder blades only to see him lose 70% hp and continue to saunter to your objective is just deflating.

But I think we could possibly make this more clear to players.\\n\\n[quote]7. - Then there's all the content being locked behind a progression system. Grind.

I'm telling my friends to pick this up ASAP, so we can run some proper group levels and really kick this toy box open.\\n\\nMy only complaint is that only one person gets the collectibles, but honestly?

       "   'review': 'I bought this game after a Dev posted on Reddit. I don\\'t usually buy things like that. But i\\'ve been itching for an old school \"toy wars\" type of game. This game is honestly really great. There are some bugs still, like sometimes enemies get stuck. But its a great tower defense style FPS that has some really amazing design work on levels. You can really feel the love that went into the level design. It\\'s also not easy, it takes work to earn the medals to unlock levels. It\\'s pretty cheap and i\\'ve enjoyed my time immensely and can\\'t wait to see the new features yet to come. At the time of review, its 13 bucks and deff worth that price for some good stress free gameplay that take you back to your childhood memories. It seems like each battle is something you pretended happened with your toys as a kid, and its really fun.\\n\\n*edit* - Mic isn\\'t bugged, it isn\\'t implimented yet according to Dev response. Removed from Con\\n\\nPros\\n - Easy to pick up\\n- Great level design\\n- Smooth Gameplay\\n- Interesting traps and buildables\\n- Takes teamwork to clear levels with high medals\\n- Cheap\\n- Lots of sweet Nostalgia moments (when I first saw the Army Men c130 I almost clapped my hands in youthful glee. Since I had one as a kid)\\n- Graphics are pretty good for this style of game. Very smooth and runnable\\n\\nCons\\n- Skins are cool, but most unlockables don\\'t effect gameplay (would be cool to have different style of guns instead of different shades of guns. Same with Characters.\\n- No vote kick system. So sometimes when you get 4 people together, there is always one guy who waits the full 2 minutes between phases without ready-ing up. It can get pretty annoying',\n",

Trap placement is extremely limited and very expensive.[/quote]\\nOur latest [url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/523660/announcements/detail/2427918161422592801]update[/url] has given more freedom when building your defences. We listened to our player feedback and have implemented changes that they had suggested. Was it specifically the traps you were not happy with? Or does this include all defences? (walls, turrets etc)\\n\\n[quote] 2. - There is a page with a small tutorial to describe the mechanics of the game, but there really should be a tutorial that you can actually play to learn the game.[/quote]\\nWe are going to add a proper tutorial which allows you to get a real feel of the game. We’re still Early Access, so the quick tutorial was something we pieced together to give players a basic understanding of the game. I apologise if the current tutorial is not clear or helpful. Please stay tuned for an update!\\n\\n[quote] 3. - Also I hate the name. It has absolutely no relation to the game itself. I understand that finding the right name for a game this unique is tough, but you can do better.[/quote]\\nOriginally it was just “HYPERCHARGE” but since we re-launched the game, it changed to Unboxed. I do however see what you are saying. In terms of describing the game by title, HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed isn’t the most ideal one to use. In future, we will look into what makes most sense when picking a name. \\n\\n[quote]4. - Being limited to only Operation Alley as a new player is foolish, there were zero sessions open with other players on that map.[/quote]\\nThe reason new players begin on Operation Alley is because the game focuses on progression, just like Orcs Must Die or similar TD games. You unlock new skins, defences and maps as you complete each level. The overall response from our community regarding this approach has been very positive as it adds more replay value. I am sorry you feel disappointed but there isn’t much we can do for you. The only thing I can think of is that there’s a Streamer mode button in the main menu at the bottom right. It unlocks a lot of content in the game. So you could give that a try. ([i]All your unlocks and progress will be lost forever if used[/i]) We are a very small indie team with little funding for marketing. I\\'m not making an excuse, just being honest with you. :) The game is becoming more popular by the day, and I\\'m confident when we leave Early Access you will find more active sessions. \\n\\nI do appreciate that you have purchased our game and taken the time to write some feedback. If you\\'re interested, it would be awesome for you to join us on [url=https://discordapp.com/invite/hyperchargeunboxed]Discord[/url]and write more in depth your suggestions. I’m sure if we work together, we can vastly improve your experience.\\n'},\n",

J\\'ai fait pas mal le tour du mode Tower Defense mais je continue beaucoup de jouer avec des amis en PvP, en mode zombie, on fait aussi des modes un peu plus \"personnalisés\" qui n\\'existent pas réellement au sein du jeu (Hide n\\' Seek, record de distance de lancé de batteries dans les cores, etc)\\n\\nJ\\'ai également découvert un moyen de propulsion que j\\'ai nommé le Edge Boost (en raison du fait que l\\'on s\\'aide d\\'un rebord pour gagner en vitesse) et qui est ultra fun à utiliser en PvP comme en PvE.\\n\\nHypercharge est un jeu développé par une poignée de personnes passionnées et ultra proche de leur communauté, donc n\\'hésitez vraiment pas à rejoindre l\\'aventure.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Loved the premise, but sadly the game feels less Tower Defense and more like a wave based shooter. Traps are extremely limited to a select few specific spots on the map and are extremely costly to build while feeling incredibly weak as well. To get money to build things, you need to run around the map between waves grabbing coins, and while I loved the idea of doing so, winds up leaving you very little time to actually build the traps since money isn't shared between players. Weapon types seem to be just upgrades you find or buy during a map, also scattered about. From what I saw, there was only a machine gun and shot gun variant, and of course each one needs to be recollected during the map.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the basic concept, but the execution I found very lacking. Was hoping for something closer to an actiony TD game like OMD, and instead got something closer to a wave based hold out game with heavy parkour elements. If you enjoy that sorta thing though, this would definitely be the game to play.\",\n",

When describing Unboxed, we class it more as a \"hybrid\" between wave-based-shooting and tower defence.

Thanks again for writing this, it all helps us! :)\\n\\nEdit - We have just released a Major Update to the game.

Eventually it worked it\\'s way to us,  but some times it would take up to 3 or 4 minutes. We were really close to quitting when it finally popped it\\'s head out\\n---- (https://imgur.com/e7Ietsm) Here was a similar case, one of the enemies got stuck behind something up there and we couldn\\'t get to it each time. Eventually it worked it\\'s way out. \\n- It doesn\\'t feel like you get enough coins for building when playing. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s just because I\\'m playing on the second difficulty or what. But with the consistent lack of coin it never feels like we can get an interesting set up going for the coming waves. \\n\\nIdeas:\\n= Coins: as I stated, I\\'m not sure if you get more on higher difficulties. But it would be cool if there was a small multiplier for \"kill streaks\" whether it\\'s from just you or your team combined. The faster you kill things in a row the more coins you get for the total kills at the end of the streak? I figured making it streak related would work because in order to beat the level you have to kill everything anyway,  so it wouldn\\'t make a ton of sense to give coins per kill (to a degree I suppose). eg, the better your set up and the faster your team kills things, the more coins your team splits to build cooler defenses.\\n\\n= There should be an option in the menu to kill yourself and go through the respawn process. A couple times my teammates would get stuck in things and they were pretty much just...screwed. So we had to beat the level, down a man. If he could have just hit a button to die, would\\'ve brought him back in to the fight!\\n\\n= This is kind of nitpicky, but It would be nice if the color of the barbed wire placements (and tank traps) were a color other then green. Only because when you have a ton of little army dudes running through, it becomes really difficult to actually see and aim at them.\\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a good game that I can\\'t wait to see what the developers continue to work with.',\n",

If you're the type of person who enjoyed toy stores, arcades, and cartoons in the 90's you'll probably enjoy this game too.\\n\\nMechanically, this game is crisp. Shooting enemies, and building a defense for your power cores feels rewarding. Graphically, the game is gorgeous. It feels like you're dropped right in the heart of a Pixar scene, and i found myself spending the first few minutes of every new map ignoring the objective and exploring. Just when you think you've found all the hidden nooks, you find a box you didn't know you could jump on, and suddenly an entire area of the map you previously though was inaccessible is made available to you. I'm excitedly waiting this games full release, and to see how other game modes are introduced. I'll be updating this review as the game develops, but for now this game is a wonderfully priced way to spend a few hours a week.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"To keep it concise, it's a solid wave shooter with some platforming thrown on top of it.\\n\\nNow for the nitpicks:\\n• Could use with at least a diagonal front sprinting mechanic;\\n• Clipping issues - in my 70 minute gameplay interval I clipped around 10-11 times;\\n• Climbing could be improved - sometimes an edge could not be recognised as such and the game will happily plunge you to remake the journey to wherever you wanted to jump on;\\n• Server connectivity - looks like the multiplayer is P2P-based and you could either get flat out disconnected or there might be just one active server and if it's half a world away from you, you won't have a happy time playing. Two or three times I got reset when I had done a big jump across the map and the game just reset me to halfway across the jump to redo it again.\\n• Gun attachments do what they think it should do, but it's sometimes not noticeable and might confuse - for example you can add a sights attachment and it should increase your accuracy. I only noticed it when I put on an Advanced Sight and it gave a little dot in the middle of my reticule. Still don't know what do the gun legs do, might be a jab at BL3, I don't know.\\n• Enemies mainly come from the same spawning spot and don't vary too much. The enemy variety on the other hand is kinda okay - soldiers, jeeps, aliens, an AC130, tanks and that one spinny thing before the latest spinny thing rage.\\n• It sometimes feels like you are waiting more than you are playing - 3 minutes cooldown every round and after every match unless the players connect faster. This might only be a Regular difficulty timer and higher difficulties might give less time to prepare, but I couldn't find a server to join in so I didn't try.\\n\\n\\n◘ At the time of writing weapons are not exactly balanced. I don't exactly hold this one as a nitpick, mainly due to the reason of balancing needing actual data to do properly. And you can't get data without players.\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say this game has a lot of potential but it needs work to make the gameplay a bit more fluid and hectic in my opinion.\\n\\nAt this time, unfortunately, I am on the fence if the game can be recommended and I say no until later.\",\n",

The only thing I can say negative is some minor lag issues, that  were most likely my horrible internet, and something that\\'s pretty annoying, enemies getting stuck in areas that you can\\'t reach. The gameplay is fun, it\\'s fun to search for coins, build your defenses, and the different enemies make it really fun (Kind of like Sanctum in the fact it\\'s a first person Tower Defense game). The maps are amazing, they make you really feel tiny, and if you are playing with friends you will constantly be pointing out things. And this game is so much fun with friends, to just go in, and kill some beyblades. And the character customization is great to, the fact that your helmet changes depending on your chest piece is awesome, the characters look amazing, and you can making cool names such as \"The Unloved Baby Boy\". The graphics are REALLY good, much better than I could ever expect. And something that really caught me by surprise was the music. Seriously, the music, is SO GOOD. Please make a soundtrack, so I can listen to it, and so I have something else to spend my money so I can support the developers. HIGHLY recommend you buy this game.',\n",

The game splits between 2 phases, one for building and setting up your defenses like lego barricades, plastic posion ivy, hot glue and more. During the build phase your able to collect coins used for constructing these defenses as well as fine hidden collectibles that require quite a bit of platforming to reach. The second phase is the action phase where you will be fighting of hordes of various toys each with their own strength, weakness, and behaviors. Right clicking allows you to zoom in but there is no aim down sights in this game. There are attachments that appear at random through your mission that can give you an alternate fire or an addon for your gun to provide a stat bonus. At the end of a mission you will be awarded with XP and a rank based on how much health the cores were left with. My only real complaint with the gameplay was that the climbing can act up at times and cause you to work your way back up to where you fell off.\\n\\nHypercharge Unboxed also features quite a bit outside of native ultra wide support. It has up to 4 player local split screen coop, private matches, a server browser, and tons of customization options to unlock like character skins, gun skins, and different playable action figures. The game is currently in early access and includes a good amount of missions with the promise of more to come, the developers have also stated they plan on adding a PVP game mode and more PVE content down the line.\\n\\nVisually the game is beautiful, the graphics and art style look amazing and I did have someone walk by quickly taking a look at the game thinking it was a toy story trailer. The variety in enemy toys really is a great addition because of the nostalgia factor it gave me, a lot of the toys where things i played with in my child hood. The audio works great and shooting the robots has a very pleasing shut down sound play when they get destroyed. Environments of each level are different and unique with my favorite having to be the toy isle. There's a lot of great jokes and references to be found littered throughout like the pc master race subreddit opened up in the bedroom, or the zerg rush deodorant in the bathroom. Performance wise i had no issues playing and no graphical issues from playing in ultra-wide either. The UI and menus can be scaled but does not have full customization in terms of placement\\n\\nOver all I enjoyed my time with HyperCharge: Unboxed, Its easy to see the developers at Digital Cybercherries put a lot of work into making this game and cared about their product. Its not perfect and could certainly use some more levels but for its asking price I would say it fulfills in giving enough content with the promise of more to come and offers a good amount of replay ability. If you dont take my word for it feel free to check out the stream review section with lots of players who feel the same way. My biggest gripe with the game was not being able to find enough players online off peak hours and thats saying something.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Holy hell is this game fun! It isn't insanely difficult nor is it stupidly easy. Boss waves are plenty difficult, and so far only the air hockey stage is really the only one I'd say is too easy (but hey, its a gimmick stage so who really cares). There aren't many people online, though that's something that I can't complain about too much since the game is pretty niche. The graphics are actually significantly better than what I expected from a low price title. The stages also have ridiculous detail, going so far as to stock the shelves and containers with objects that look like they could be found in real life toy stores. Ever since I saw the first post about this game on imgur, its always been in the back of my mind. It seemed fun and interesting. Though I haven't used it yet, couch co-op is always, ALWAYS, a welcome addition to any game. Glad the devs implemented it.\\n\\nI only have a few complaints that I really hope get fixed, though they don't change my mind on whether or not to recommend this game.\\n\\nWeapon types are like, really rare. Of all my gameplay I think I only got a secondary weapon twice, and I've only repeated one level.\\nLack of content. There are plenty of maps under development at the map selection screen, so this will for sure be fixed very soon. PvP would also be a neat addition, just remove the hypercores and let players shoot each other.\\nVehicles are ridiculously bulky. It takes so long to wear down a tank or a jeep, even when they stand absolutely still. I'm fine with boss vehicles like the plane being stupidly bulky, but regular ones shouldn't take multiple full clips to take down.\\n\\nThis game is still extremely fun and well worth the $15. My only regret with this purchase is waiting so long to get it. I saw the first couple posts about it on imgur back whenever that was, but I didn't bite for whatever reason until recently. I'm glad I did. Now I just have to convince my friends to buy it....\",\n",

Was auch etwas doof ist das man sich die Waffen mit denen man schiesen will nicht vom Anfang an auswählen kann und man statt dessen so Dreckwaffen bekommt wie eine Schrot die 4 Schuss hat dann 10 sec nachladen muß. Also ist man eigentlich die hälfte der Zeit am nachladen was ehrlich gesagt mehr nervt als es bringt. Und wenn das einen alles nicht stört ist es ein schönes Spiel.',\n",

Both of us were doing well, but got overwhelmed at the last level. Too many enemies, not enough time to reload while they swarm over the protect items. \\n\\nAs a primarily Solo player, I cannot recommend this game.\\n\\nFor any of the devs reading this, your requirements for base cosmetics and maps is far too high.',\n",

The next issue is the lack of a microphone icon over a players health and shield bars when they speak so you have to guess whos talking. And a minor issue is that you have to utilize a coursor based movement for menuing which could of been only for a mouse rather than a controller.\\n\\nAside from that i love this game and would recommend this out to any and everyone who wants to play with toys in a battlefield of someones home while jamming out to the hit track by Edwin Starr - War\",\n",

       "   'review': '[h1][b]\"It\\'s like Toy Story + Tower Defense + Killing Floor.\"[/b][/h1]\\n\\nThat\\'s how I\\'d best describe this game. If you\\'re looking for a strategy-shooter game, this is it. It\\'s incredibly polished, fun, and challenging and works quite well with a group of friends. \\n\\n[b][i]HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed[/i][/b] puts you in the shoes of an action figure defending 3 \"HYPER-CORES\" until the end through multiple waves of varying enemies and fun encounters to mix up the flow of things.\\n\\nI can assure you that the $15 asking price at this current point in time is well worth it. I saw the trailer for the 2.0 update on Reddit before purchasing and was blown away. It\\'s surprisingly polished for what it is and brings me back the feel of those old-school toy soldier shooters you\\'d play as a kid, but with an amazing twist.\\n\\nEven if you\\'re not thinking about purchasing it in the current state, I\\'d still recommend you\\'d at least follow the development as it\\'s extremely promising in the early state it\\'s in so far. I can\\'t wait to see what\\'s next from the devs. Kudos to what they\\'ve made.\\n\\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\\n+ Extremely polished look and feel.\\n+ Wonderful graphics, sounds, models, and details.\\n+ Each map feels hand-crafted and unique\\n+ [b]NO MICROTRANSACTIONS[/b]. It has a robust progression and earning system without having to pay a dime.\\n+ Large variety of placeables, maps, customization, and enemies.\\n+ Friendly UI.\\n+ Incredibly easy to learn.\\n+ Intuitive movement.\\n+ Responsive developers who take criticism kindly and feedback importantly.\\n+ Friendly community.\\n+ Well-developed progression system.\\n+ Splitscreen and controller support.\\n+ $15 Price. Well worth it.\\n+ Humor and easter eggs dotted throughout each map.\\n\\n[b][u]MIXED[/u][/b]\\n= Card loadout selection system makes you use a \\'wheel movement\\' making it more difficult to view your card options.\\n= Soldier names must be selected through an in-game system only. No Steam names hovering over players that I can tell. An option to switch between these names would be nice.\\n= Placed objects can feel sometimes easy to break and there have few placement positions.\\n= You must hold down your mouse to build. Every second counts - feels wasted having structures not build on their own.\\n= Credit packs can be picked up by anyone. They\\'re not local like coins. This sucks when you can\\'t find any on your own.\\n= Coins can be hidden until you begin at the start of a trail. It\\'s easy to forget or see where they are when you leave some.\\n= Collectibles are local and collected per-player with hard to reach locations. They\\'re not shared which can suck in groups.\\n\\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\\n- Bugs. LOTS. (As to be expected, but there are multiple times when enemies get stuck and I\\'m unable to find them.)\\n- Shooting can feel off when given close-range weapons on large maps and with long-range on small maps for the first time playing on them.\\n- Frustrating jumps due to some wonky colliders and hard to reach credits/collectibles/locations.\\n- No ability to choose weapon loadouts to use across games and maps as far as I\\'m aware.\\n- Credits can be extremely limited when playing in small groups making you repair more than you build. Devs need to respawn coins, increase credit pack spawn rates, or give players small credit amounts for killing enemies DESPERATELY to fix this\\n- Balance issues. It’s just not worth working towards large objects to place as you NEVER have enough for them. You’re always repairing as your structures do little damage as you never are usually able to receive enough credits to build stronger ones. This and player damage needs to be seriously looked at because if we have limited credits we should at least have increased player damage.\\n- Multiplayer server instability.\\n\\n[b][u]PERSONAL SUGGESTIONS (FOR DEVS)[/u][/b]\\n> A jetpack or a grappling hook would be neat for easier core management.\\n> Shared collectibles\\n> Per-player credit packets like coins.\\n> [b]Small kill credit reward.[/b] HIGHLY needed especially to even think about winning harder difficulties with a few players.\\n> Overall view of available cards option for your loadout instead of using a wheel selection system to compare cards easy.\\n> Optional automatic building system setting instead of having to hold down a button.\\n> Customizable weapon loadouts that work across maps and games.\\n> The ability to use our steam names would be preferred.\\n> Damage modifier options or slightly increased weapon damage overall as credits can be scarce.\\n> Support for dedicated/headless servers hosted by players would be great in the future.\\n> [b]STEAM WORKSHOP PLEASE PAPA.[/b]\\n\\nThis game has huge potential and I can\\'t wait to see what the devs do with it next. If you were interested enough in reading this review, you\\'re almost certainly interested enough to play this game and I can\\'t recommend it enough. It\\'s refreshing to see developer feedback and comments as well showing they truly care about this early access title. Looking forward to seeing what\\'s in store in the future. I\\'ve only played a few hours at the time of this review so there may be some contingencies on certain things I\\'ve said that turn out to be already in the game. Nonetheless it\\'s a great pickup.\\n\\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] This is an extremely polished fast-paced early access game with enormous potential. It\\'s a first person tower defense done right that expertly brings a twist to old-school nostalgia from early toy soldier shooters. Each moment is engaging - but with a fair share of bugs and areas for future improvement that are only to be met with the road ahead. It\\'s like Toy Story + Tower Defense + Killing Floor. Huge future potential.\\n\\n[h1][b][Score] 8.5/10[/b][/h1]\\n\\n[b] EDIT:[/b] Apparently custom maps through the Steam Workshop are most likely not happening according to the devs. I feel as if that’s a huge missed opportunity, but oh well.',\n",

       "   'review': \"[b] if you ever wanted to be action figures vaulting over cardboard boxes and fighting off hordes of enemies just to protect an objective like you're the main character in an upcoming classic GI: Joe movie then this game is for you. [/b]\\n\\n\\nI haven't put a ton of time into this game, but I can assure you it is worth way more than the 15$ you are going to spend. The update that it recently received could be considered a new game in itself with only the feel of the original lingering in the air.\\n\\nHyperCharge: Unboxed is best played with friends but is completely enjoyable just by yourself.\\nit is an incredibly cool take on the original tower defense games, and while this genre has been done before. The dev team has out done themselves by making this game a unique experience for the player.\\n\\nThe graphics are an amazing. first off, while they are pretty realistic you will still get this feeling that you’re just a plastic doll running around the map. a lot of the things you can jump on and identify throughout the map push that art choice. That allows you to get extremely immersed in the game; even before you start the tower defense aspect of it.\\n\\nThe defense aspect of it isn't anything too new at least on the surface, each character before playing can select 3 cards to take with them to build with. each card is a defense which will impede or attack enemies before they reach the core. The main difference from other games is that you also get your own weapon which can have at least two different gun types attached to it. this setup allows for a lot of customization between players.\\n\\nthis leads into the gameplay, which is an incredible mix of strategy and just plain fun when playing with your friends. For each level there are 3 different difficulties with 3 different medals for each that you can earn. Medals are achieved by how many objectives are left standing by the end. My only grip right now with the gameplay is that it needs a mode where the waves don’t end for each level. that would make playing levels over again more enjoyable.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'The prior release was incredibly bare bones. It was certainly more of a tech demo than a proper game.\\nAnd once the novelty of \"woah, you\\'re a toy!!\" wore off, the fundamental flaws reared their ugly heads.\\n\\nThe new gameplay was built from the ground up. With mostly art assets being rolled over from previous versions.\\nAnd the arguably terrible game systems and design choices of the early release have been overwritten with one of the best co-op experiences I\\'ve played to date.\\n\\nMassive open arenas to explore with impeccable amounts of detail. Every level is filled bottom to top with explorable crevices, each one harbouring its own secret.\\nBe it an item to enhance your defenses/offences, or a collectible for the plethora of cosmetic rewards available, or a funny easter egg.\\n\\nGun combat is punchy and each weapon feels like it\\'s doing damage. Unlike the 1.0 release which felt unresponsive and unimpactful. There\\'s a new melee system in place now.\\nWith an upgradable melee weapon attachment that could be found if you take your time to explore. \\nMuch more variety in buildables. All of which are unlocked via a leveling system. Which was absent in the prior release.\\nThere\\'s an incentive to actually play now. Rather than the \"everything is unlocked from the get-go, this is what you do, do it\" approach of the previous release. \\nAnd though that approach remains similar in the new update. There\\'s so much more variation in between the start of the game and the end objective.\\n\\nIn the early release, there was a single core you had to defend against and a single, or branching paths for enemies to traverse. After each wave, enemies would drop currency and a single battery would spawn at the core. Which incentivised staying at the core and attacking from a distance since there wasn\\'t much of a reason to\\ndo anything else. (Not that there was to begin with.) Then, this was repeated until you died. Since it was essentially endless.\\n\\nThe new gameplay loop follows a similar theme of- kill enemies, collect loot, kill enemies. Though it\\'s much more varied in that approach. Enemies no longer drop loot. Instead loot and batteries are dispersed around the map in hidden and obvious areas after every wave that you must traverse to, to collect.\\n\\nAdditionally, the most fundamental part of the game of protecting the cores was expanded upon and you\\'ll now need to protect 2 more. Each in a different location around the map, each one with varied buildable placements.\\n\\nEnemy placement has also been expanded upon. It\\'s still the same wave of enemies fiasco but instead of them all coming from a single point, they have multiple spawn points around the map and should one of your 3 cores go down, some enemies that would b-line for a particular core will re-route and attack a different core. Assisting the enemies that were already attacking.\\n\\nThere is SO much more I could talk about. Such as the new battery system, gun attachments system and the buildables system. But there needs to be some things left to explore yourself.\\n\\nThere are certainly its flaws, such as matchmaking, some minor server instabilities, a few clipping issues and unbalanced pricing for buildables.\\nThese are all guaranteed to be fixed in future updates.\\n\\nBut right now, this is easily one of the best Action Tower Defense games from what I\\'ve played and for $15 it\\'s honestly hard to pass up.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Really fun game with a lot of detail and effort.\\nTo clarify, there are lots of minute details players might miss, each box is incredibly detailed with scuffs, barcodes, writing, postage stamps and various other small details, the floor is covered in scuff marks, shopping cart marks, bits of dirt and everything else you would expect to have been in say a Toys“R”Us store. I wont go into detail about everything that the developers painstakingly added because there's far too much to comment on. Needless to say they added a ridiculous amount of detail to each and every map of the game. So I encourage everyone that plays the game to take a look around the maps and see all the easter eggs and detail the team put in whenever there's a lull between the waves.\\nGameplay wise it's very fun, the guns feel nice, the enemies are varied (though I think there could be a bit more variation that said it is an Early Access game) I'm not entirely pleased that each map has its own specific loadout with the possibility of finding new weapons across spawns on the map.\\nI'm not entirely thrilled with the buildables either, there's variety there but it feels much too spread out (each buidable has 3 levels and each level is listed in the buildable menu as its own buildable)\\nAnother minor issue is that there are secrets on each map, if you're in co-op with a friend and someone claims a secret you cant claim that secret without restarting the map and play it again after having finished it.\\nI think the game is incredibly well made and painstakingly polished and if you're looking for something fun to play with a friend or two it's a very enjoyable experience.\\n\\nUpdate. PC version has taken a backseat to the nintendo switch version of the game\\nwith the switch version getting preferential treatment over the PC in terms of updates and support\\nthe devs have been deleting comments on their discord and banning people who ask for updates on the steam build of the game\",\n",

The batteries make the tower defense aspect of it a bit more fun because you constantly need to keep an eye on the drain meters in the top corner.  Visuals are not bad and controls play like any standard FPS game. Would recommend if it is under 10 bucks.',\n",

Fun game with 4 player split screen on PC! mechanics still need some fine tuning but overall its a fun immersive TD, with a ton of charm and detail that can make it easily contend with most AAA caliber games from a small and talented  team. Every new level I experienced my jaw sank further. Though it still is a bit stiff and by no means my favorite format for a TD. This game has a ton of character charm and inventiveness to give it a must own status for those who want a fun and challenging coop game. One or two more patches and this could hit classic status.',\n",

       "   'review': \"Don't look for tutorials, do not watch gameplay, just go into this blind if you're a mid 80's to 90's person. Trust me.\\nIt's not quite there yet, but the game has potential and promise. The devs have made it look nice so far, it runs fluid with just a few bugs that don't ruin the fun completely.\\nJust don't explore the map too much, you'll risk being stuck in a box with kitchenware like I did.\\n\\nThe most difficult thing to fight off is the urge to explore and stare at details, and the feeling of nostalgia all around you.\\nIf you grew up with an NES/SNES, had fisher price toys (knights escpecially), or have been into a Toys R Us- you'll get some sort of magical feel from playing this on your first go at this. If you're in your 20's-30's pick the Attic map, it's worth it.\\n\\nI have to mention that I've only seen 9 enemy types, with 6 different varitations of those 9.\\nThe 5/6 different variations mostly come in the following colour-coded difficulty:\\n\\nGreen = Easy/Normal\\nBlue = Normal/Annoying\\nRed = Annoying/Difficult\\nBlack = Micro-boss Jerks or Bullet Sponges. Sometimes both.\\nYellow/Tan? = Diabolical Evil made by yet another anonymous dev.\\n\\nYou fight the following per wave, and is [u]usually[/u] in this pattern:\\n\\nWave 1: Robots folks... They will rock and sock you, so keep your chin up (no wait-).\\nWave 2: Franken-Zombies + Exploding Squishy Goblin late 80's feeling things.\\nWave 3: Beyblades. These little zips group up on players and can kill quick- THEY COME FROM EVERYWHERE!\\nWave 4: Army Men + Tanks + Jeeps + Helicopters + Jets + Dying alot. My favourite of enemies so far, well done devs.\\n\\nOverall still fun opponents to fight. Not bashing, but if you've spent 6 hours trying to find 2 more different waves of different type toys to come at you, you might be let down. Looking forward to more enemies now though, would love to see plastic/metal toy knights, a little battering ram, a dragon, and some little wizards doing dumb stuff to my turrets.\\n\\nMoving on.\\nWeapons are fun, let's talk about fun.\\nIn the menu you have a loadout, in the loadout you can choose 2 out of 5 weapons to have with you in battle.\\nChoose carefully because doubling up on the same weapon is also an option.\\n\\nThe weapons so far are:\\nRifle (Full auto rifle with 30 bullets per reload, this is your balanced weapon. Mid Damage, Range, and Recoil)\\nMachine Gun (LMG with 120 bullets per reload, this is high recoil, high damage, and semi-low range)\\nLaser (Powered by protons probably, with 60 protons per reload, low/mid-damage mid-range, blinding beams of light.)\\nShotgun (Slow rate of fire with 6 shells per reload, slow reload, highest damage output, painfully low-range)\\nGrenade Launcher (only fits one little turd Malteser in the chamber, great splash damage and high impact damage.)\\n\\nBy default you have the Rifle and Shotgun equipped in your loadout.\\n\\nOnto the tower defense aspect of the game.\\nMuch like your loadout, well... IN YOUR LOADOUT, you have the option to pick your 3 building options.\\nAll building options can be upgraded to level 3, and change certain characteristics of each building differently.\\nUsually it's just improved damage, possibly health, or in some cases it changes the weapon type a little bit.\\n\\nThe options so far are:\\nMachine Gun Turret (Just a simple automated turret, like Team Fortress 2, it can be upgraded with some parts/points.)\\nRocket Launcher Turret (This is like the grenade launcher weapon, but automated and improved upon. Slow though.)\\nSpike Trap Mat (Mat goes down, spikes jet upward into enemies when stepped upon. Straight forward and fun.)\\nElectro Shock Turret (Not sure if this is working yet, but it shocks the area around the tower. Jolts the enemies with lecky.)\\nFire Trap Mat (Mat goes down, bbq starts when your guests arrive. It's the spike trap with flames!)\\nHairy Floor Goop (Possibly the most expensive goop on the market, this slows your enemies... kinda. Needs some work.)\\nPoison Ivy? Trap (Give your enemies a rash, and hope they die of allergic reaction. Cost effective but very low damage)\\nWind Turret (This deafens you and your team, while pushing enemies 3mm back to where they just were. Good times!)\\nSea Mine (On land, blows up when touched, cost effective to an extent. Kinda last-resort for overwhelming hordes.)\\n\\nI think that's about it, I need sleep now, but will update more and fix more of this review later on.\\nGet this game with 3 other friends, the player count is low but the game is fun.\",\n",

The graphics is really good. I liked idea of being a little toy soldier.\\nBut after that, feelings started changing to negative. There were so much incomprehensible thing in the game. \\n\\nBasically, the game is Orc Must Die in other setting. You have a hero, you can shoot at enemies using weapon or building tower.

Hopefully you all enjoy it as much as we did.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGwlRlZZUBk&feature=youtu.be\\n\\n\\nReview:\\n\\nThe concept of this game was very interesting. We liked the idea of the 3 colored zones and the power nodes that powered each area. The problem that we had with the game is that it got boring after the first 7 waves. When there is no real end to the game it can get boring over time. After about 40 minutes of playing, we felt that we had already done everything that the game had to offer. \\n\\nWe would have really liked to see a leveling system especially since we see that we are getting some sort of experience points when defeating enemies. \\n\\nThe AI seems to be pretty good, but alot of times enemies would get stuck outside the map or really high up on the shelves and not move so it became a game of hide and seek in a sense. \\n\\nOther than that, for an early access game it is very good and we definately would recomend this game to people who like tower defence games, but I am sure we all would like to see alot more added in order to give the game a little bit more of a purpose.\\n\\nKEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!\",\n",

       "   'review': '(3/30/19) UPDATES to my initial review below, because the latest patches have improved things a lot. Still some quibbles, but as many have recently stated, the game is a lot more fun now. I\\'m most definitely sticking with it, and recently got a friend started on it, too, because it\\'s clear that the devs are headed in the right direction and will have a very solid, addictive title on their hands if they stick with it.\\n\\nTHINGS THEY\\'VE IMPROVED:\\n\\n1. MOVEMENT. Walking speed now feels a bit more natural, and sprinting has resolved the worst of the slow movement issues. Jumping seems a bit better, which is good because a lot of the maps rely on jumping puzzles for you to get to more credits and upgrades. Timing the double-jump still seems a bit annoying, but maybe that\\'s just me.\\n\\n2. RELOADING. They\\'ve improved this for sure. Reloads now take a more logical amount of time, but I\\'d argue that it would still be a lot better if they used an animation instead of a HUD element. \\n\\n3. DEAD BATTERIES. Dead batteries just disappear, which resolved the worst of the mix-ups. But spare batteries that you stockpile next to your Cores also have indicators. The fix was so organic, I\\'d forgotten there was even an issue last time until I re-read my review. Thumbs up. Also, the game isn\\'t nearly as battery-hungry anymore, thank God. I like having to worry about them as part of the world-building, but managing them constantly wasn\\'t a fun part of the game. This feels well-balanced now.\\n\\n\\nTHINGS THEY HAVEN\\'T IMPROVED:\\n\\n1. WEAPONS. My gripe here still stands--some weapons just don\\'t look different enough from each other (for more detail, see below). Also, due to lack of tutorial, it\\'s hard to tell if I select a new \"weapon\" in the character screen if I\\'m fundamentally changing the weapon or just the skin. Feels like the latter, but it\\'s hard to tell because the weapons still lack some character. They \"feel\" a lot better now in terms of punch, sound, and effects (kudos to devs), but they still lack flavor until you grab certain upgrades. Perfect example is the Machine Gun, which I actually think is WORSE than the default Assault Rifle due to its terrible accuracy until you get some SIGHTS. Just one problem--the upgrades don\\'t stick around...they disappear at the end of a campaign. So at the end, I don\\'t feel I made any progress. I urge the devs to consider an upgrade system more like DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, where the player can make choices that dictate play style instead of being stuck with whatever upgrades a mission decides to randomly spawn.\\n\\n2. UPGRADES. In addition to the weapon problem above, upgrading your traps is, frankly, unfun. I see a lot of cool traps I\\'d like to use, but the pace at which the game unlocks them doesn\\'t have that \"one more round so I can unlock another upgrade\" feel that DEEP ROCK GALACTIC has mastered. Also, even though I\\'ve unlocked several new traps, I haven\\'t bothered equipping them because they\\'re too expensive to build. I never have enough credits to build all the default traps, so something that cost 3x as much and only \"slows down\" the enemy is something that will never get built. Feels like they need to structure their trap system more like ORCS MUST DIE.\\n\\n\\nONE FINAL NOTE\\n\\n-WORLDBUILDING. I love the devs dedication to bringing a toylike world to life. In the last campaign, when my friend and I were hit with an unexpected wave of Green Army Men, plastic tanks, jeeps, and a big green plastic C130 Hercules that kept dropping paratroopers on us until we finally shot it down, felt amazing. That\\'s what the game should strive for. That being said, for my two cents I wish they would abandon the \"Credit\" system of build management and go with something more organic to the world they\\'ve built. Chasing around floating coins feels very Mario, and not at all in line with the careful logic of much of what they\\'ve created. Feels like instead they should create a system with 3-4 \"resources\" with which you can build any trap, depending on class. If, for example, they had piles of Legos you could mine to build the Lego walls, extra batteries to build little shock traps, or cigarette lighters you can pull lighter fluid from for flame traps. Right now, grabbing gold coins so my action figure can lay \"poison vines\" doesn\\'t feel like something that fits the story logic. Feels like filler to get a game concept to work. You can do better, devs!\\n\\nCONCLUSION: They\\'re moving in the right direction, they just haven\\'t hit that pure joy echelon yet. Get it at an Early Access price while you still can!\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM LATE 2018)\\n\\nWill definitely be playing this more, because it shows massive potential. Graphics feel really fun and clean--puts me right back into being a kid. Weapons feel satisfying, gameplay ideas seem solid. Because this is Early Access, I want to put my most immediate things that turn me off, hoping they will fix these:\\n\\n1. MOVEMENT. Especially--dear God--JUMPING. Feels slow and clunky, especially when fighting something fast like the spinners. I don\\'t know what it is about the double-jump, but it\\'s really hard to nail down compared to so many shooters. Trying to double-jump up the side of a box to replace the battery in something while your defenses are failing...and repeatedly dry-humping the box instead of scaling it...is the most frustrating feeling in the world.\\n\\n2. WEAPONS - the default weapon can switch between Assault Rifle and Shotgun modes--not that you can tell the difference. When you flip from one to the other, they don\\'t look significantly different, so it\\'s easy to forget in the heat of a fight which one you\\'ve got equipped...and reloading takes so long you don\\'t want to mix them up.\\n\\n3. RELOADING - does it have to take this long? And if it does, we need a way cooler animation that a spinny loading icon.\\n\\n4. DEAD BATTERIES - Some kind of charge indicator on the side of batteries would be super helpful, even if it\\'s just in the helpful special vision mode--because of the way they pile up at the bottom of your energy pylons, it\\'s damn near impossible to cycle through the used ones to get to one relatively fresh. Playing \"Which battery\\'s got juice?\" in the middle of a toy invasion isn\\'t my idea of fun difficulty.\\n\\nOther than those UI tweaks, having  great time! But those small frustrations add up, and can seriously dampen enthusiasm for a game.',\n",

       "   'review': \"THE TURRETS and buildable items in the update are rediculously expensive, so expensive that i have never gotten to use any of them. I used to be able to actually upgrade and buy them in the old build of the game. So the money system needs some adjustment. I have to UNLOCK the skins now!!!????? I already had all of them before!!!!! Secondary fire is gone.... not cool cause it was awesome to be able to switch from a machine gun to a grenade launcher when that old gun spin animation that used to be there. The game is very unstable compared to the way that it used to be. This game used to be playable on the GPD Win 2 but not any more.\\nPlease do not try to be a copy and paste of call of duty as you can do better than that.\\nIf you add a story mode to this game with some voice acting sort of like The army men games i can see ALOT of potential. Maybe the Hypercharge soldiers Vs. the Crusaders sort of thing? and the zombies came fom the crusades cursed unholy land? While the dinosaur men try to hunt all other teams?\\nAnd this game would be just DLC survival mode for the main game?\\nI do like those new toy traps for the tanks, zombies, and other enemies allot though so who ever thought of that should get a raise.\\nI did notice the enemies drop coins now which is cool, they used to be money bags which isn't much of a change except for the now randomly placed floating money bags there are around the maps now lol.\\nWhat happened to the map that only had one core? It was a great map and i don't think you should have completely gotten rid of the map with only one core. It is what started it all....\\nOver all is a great game to play in split-screen with a buddy, BUT 4 player split-screen tends to always crash the game so it should be addressed.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Some work is definitely needed, but thats not a surprise. Its early access! Some things of note;\\n\\nThe BeyBlades get stuck behind the map in Toy Aisle 1, and can be a nuisance.\\nThere was a fair bit of upgrade glitches. Sometimes an upgraded turret or bunker would disappear. Or the gun part would disappear, and it would stop functioning. Sometimes for only one player, sometimes for both players.\\n\\nIn grampas attic, a number of waves spawned with zero enemies, leaving us locked out.\\n\\nI bought it to play with my roommate together. We put in a few games. It was good fun save for the above glitches that clearly weren't intended. As for some actual game design things;\\n\\nTurret descriptions and maybe some stats could be improved. I'm STILL not entirely sure what the shockwave turret does even after using it in game! It didn't seem terribly affective. Maybe some hard numbers like range or radius in tiles, damage dealt or a damage per second count off, something of that sort.\\n\\nHaving the ability to crouch would be quite helpful, especially with the bunker.\\n\\nEnemies: For the most part, this was good. Lots of variety and interest. Maybe work on balancing the waves; the army men waves are hellish, while the robot waves are sort of a joke. \\n\\nI love what you guys are doing and this game is definitely one that seems fun for a quick pop on and mess around kind of thing with friends. Looking forwards to seeing it when its better polished!\\n\",\n",

From this experience alone I have High hopes for this game as I feel the Devs really have alot of passion to look after their player base.\\n\\nI enjoy the game I love the fact you can customise your Character, Weapon and Turrets but it feels a little bare bones at the moment but that is to be expected being this early into the game's release.\\n\\nGame play I see no need to Aim Down Sights I would much prefer right mouse to just Fire my second weapon as switching weapons can be some what slow and to be honest I didnt see much of a use for ADS as the hip fire is just fine and that was with a Machine Gun. I would like the option to be able to choose which Turret to place.\\n\\nArt style is fantastic..enough said on that\\n\\nAs of now as I said before its bare bones but a worthy investment as I really feel the Devs are going to push forward and make this game a treuly remarkable work of art.\\n\\nI would like to see a Development plan.\",\n",

The characters, enemies, and mechanics are make for an incredible experience. Many of the things I thought were bad initially have been either fixed or completely overhauled. Please read my updated review below.\\n\\nEDITING:  Early Access 2.0\\n\\nPROS: \\n+ Graphics are BEAUTIFUL\\n+ Gameplay is SOLID\\n+ Maps are AMAZING\\n+ Attention to DETAIL is incredible in the level design, truly no other game compares. \\n+ Music is absolutely incredible\\n+ Collectables\\n+ Missing Scoring System\\n+ Gameplay can be challenging\\n+ Huge nostalgia throughout the game (80\\'s and 90\\'s kids will love this)\\n+ Character customization options! I did not expect that.\\n+ Progression added for 2.0, unlocks etc. (really helps gameplay and replay)\\n+ Name system is hilarious (I made mine \"Doctor Good Finger\")\\n\\nCONS: \\n- Small Community\\n- Relatively long periods of waiting between patches, but the effort shows when it happens\\n- New weapon system seems confusing\\n- The update to turret pricing versus how many credits you get in a match seems unbalanced. Example: I cannot buy my 1000 credit turret in a game. I don\\'t earn enough while in a match. so I just put down small traps and stuff. \\n\\nFurther Thoughts for EA 2.0:\\n\\nThis game STILL holds up. Its so beautiful, fun, and challenging. This is truly one of the most underrated games of this year. \\n\\nI\\'ve been on the train for about 2 years now, and I could not be happier with this product and its development. \\n\\nIf you\\'re on the fence about this game, think of it like this...Its 15 bucks. Its chock full of content. The environments are absolutely gorgeous, and no other game does a Toy Soldier game better. No, not even the ones from your past. At its current price and state, this game is well worth the money.',\n",

I think alot still needs to be added though, a remove tool/ upgrade tool for turrets and walls so credits are more useful. Maybe bosses through waves. I think adding a battery charger, instead of being given batteries every wave would be a cool idea. weapon stats so you actually know whats the difference between guns, plus attactments actually doing things. maybe a points system so you can unlock guns and attactments.

Once they introduce more enemy & defence types to add a bit more variety, possibly even a player leveling system between each wave it may hold attention for longer periods.\\n\\nThe Visuals are superb, better than some AAA titles. There are plenty of little jokes hidden around the levels, which you can hunt for between waves that adds a little something to the enjoyment.

       "   'review': \"I will be adding occasional, concise updates regarding changes significant enough to mention in the comments on this review to keep information up to date without making this review a multi-page essay.\\n\\n[b]Summary [/b]\\n\\nHYPERCHARGE: Unboxed is a pleasant surprise. I absolutely love Co-Op wave based survival games and tower defense games so seeing this pop up on Steam's Upcoming was exciting. I decided to just go for it with semi-low expectations and pick it up on release for $15 and I'm honestly glad I did. In it's current state, an early pre-alpha, it doesn't offer a lot in terms of content or replayability but what it has in copious amounts is potential. The visuals are incredible, mechanically it's very solid, combat and movement is polished and fluid, has a great and fitting soundtrack and overall the audio is pretty good. Digital Cybercherries have also heavily emphasized community interaction and personally working with them to make HYPERCHARGE the best it can be. The foundation for an incredible game is here and what you'd be primarily paying for currently is an investment and support in the development team as well as a chance to watch this game and its community grow. I have owned my fair share of Early Access games and a lot of them have been abandoned or failed to become a worthwhile game but based on what HYPERCHARGE has and the commitment promised from the developers I have a lot of faith and excitement for this games future.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n[b] Pros [/b] \\n\\n* Visuals are impressive, almost a bit surreal. They really nailed the toy store aesthetic between the plastics, toy boxes, visual effects, sounds, and overal scale.\\n\\n* Though you are usually confined to the isle of a toy store, there's a whole new level of freedom when you're the size of an action figure. You're able to climb up through all the boxes, racks, and hangars making the toy store feel more like a jungle, adding an unexepected depth to the isles.\\n\\n* A lot of little easter eggs and comedic design hidden throughout the game. Exploring the map and checking out all the various toys on the shelves is pretty entertaining.\\n\\n* The mechanics, movement, and gunplay are really solid and surprisngly well polished. Overall the game feels great to play.\\n\\n* There's a fair amount of customization for your player model and they executed it very well. The models are very well done, from the color schemes to the general design and you can have the color scheme persist to your weapons and turrets.\\n\\n* It runs well. Rarely dip below 60 FPS max settings @1440p with a GTX 780. \\n\\n* Comprehensive settings menu for graphics, controls, audio, and some gameplay.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n[b] Cons [/b]\\n\\n[i]Keep in mind, this game is pre-alpha. The developers have stressed how early in development this game is so expect the usual lack of content, bugs, and general quirks of a pre-alpha game. I will use strikes and italics to represent changes since I wrote this review[/i]\\n\\n* There's not a lot of content or replayability at the moment. There's [strike]no progression so the entirety of the game currently consists of playing on [/strike] also not a lot of progression yet, mainly consists of upgrading defenses but there is an inactive exp system for future updates. Currently there is only 4 maps with 5 weapons and 5 mostly cosmetic attatchments to choose from. [strike]and a few turrets.[/strike] [i]There are now 11 buildables, added traps.[/i]\\n\\n* There are some bugs. [strike]The most notable so far are the audio for the MG turrets will frequently get stuck on an infinite loop until you restart and enemies can sometimes get stuck outside the map requiring you to restart the match.[/strike] [i]Word from the developers is this has been fixed.[/i]\\n\\n* Multiplayer can be a bit laggy. Not unplayable by any means but it's inconvenient at times.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\\n\\nShould you buy it? Short answer, Yes, if you don't mind the typical Early Access investment of buying an incomplete in development game. HYPERCHARGE does what it sets out to do very well so far and if a Co-Op survival tower defense game is up your alley then this is the game for you. If none of the above applies to you I recommend either skipping this one or keeping an eye on it as it recieves more updates. However, you can tell easily within the first two hours if it's something you'd want to keep, giving you the option to pick it up and refund it if you don't want it.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"This game is really impressive and quite a lot of fun! As a warning, the game is dead, but it deserves so much more. Here's some details:\\n\\nThe graphics are beautiful, the maps are extremely detailed down to the text on the toy boxes even getting a laugh out me from time to time. Everything looks great and has real charm to it, amazing work for such a small dev team. \\n\\nLet's talk the devs. They are the most open and friendly devs I have seen on any video game. I've had multiple discussions one on one or even with multiple devs at the same time over anything I seem to post on Steam Forums or their Discord, they respond to EVERYTHING, and quite timely as well. That is unheard of in today's industry and they are champs for doing so. You can tell this game is a passion product and they worked very hard.\\n\\nThe gameplay itself is very clever and can be a real blast. I admit I struggle to play the game solo but with a good sale and friends on board this game has serious potential. You fight off waves of different toys in different maps to defend your hypercores. Using different tools and traps you can build fun defenses for your cores. Fighting off toy soldiers, those bayblade things and other sorts of toys is a blast! There are loads of items to collect which turn into loads of character customization options. No microtransactions in this game, true heroes. They have really made something special here and the maps are beautiful and a joy to be in. I can't express how cool, large and detailed some of these maps can be, Toy Store for example is amazing your first time in. I haven't unlocked them all because I don't have friends to play with, but there is loads of content in this game. \\n\\nThere are multiple online modes both for PVP and PVE, but unfortunately the game is dead. So if your friends don't hop on board don't expect to find people to play with. Discord is your best bet. \\n\\nTo sum things up, this game in my opinion is worth every penny. It's beautiful, fun, charming and a very well polished game. I don't think I've encountered any bugs and have a smile on my face every time I play. If you love the toy soldier genre, this game is a must have. I hope in the future they do more sales and build the community because this is hands down the best toy soldier game out there, along with Mean Greens.\",\n",

First and for most its really irritating when you're in between waves and you cant explore because one person decided to switch to their weapon and the wave starts not allowing the team to explore or build defences.\\n\\n2. The bay blade enemies seem quite over powered to me (even on low difficulty) as they're very hard to hit and destroy barricades and core way too quick.\\n\\n3. It's really annoying that you can not swap out your loadout and cosmetics between games and instead have to quit the lobby you are in, in order too equip new buildables or weapons.\\n\\n4. Not being able to tell where the enemies are coming from is a bit frustrating too as you don't know how to build defences according especially if you're playing the map for the first time.\\n\\n5. The flame thrower attachment seems to be quite weak for what it is i think.\\n\\n6.The purple shield collectibles seem to be able to be collected only once ever but they don't dissapear once you've got them the one time you can.\\n\",\n",

Extra points for this.\\nThe variety in enemy types, weapon pickups and character designs took a lot of evident effort. I believe the creators should be truly commended for this. The first time bouncy balls showed up had me go \"Oh S**t there\\'s goddamn bouncy balls!\" out loud... I never thought I\\'d be afraid of bouncy balls!\\n\\n10/10 excellent fun game.',\n",
